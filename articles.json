      "content": "Anthropic has until Friday evening to either give the U.S. military unrestricted access to its AI model or face the consequences, reportsAxios.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei in ameeting Tuesday morningthat the Pentagon will either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — a designation usually reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor a version of the model to the military’s needs.\n\nThe DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense. It was recently invoked during the COVID-19 pandemic to compel companies like General Motors and 3M to produce ventilators and masks, respectively.\n\nAnthropic has long stated that it doesn’t want its technology used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons — and is refusing to compromise on these points.\n\nPentagon officials have argued the military’s use of technology should be governed by U.S. law and constitutional limits, not by the usage policies of private contractors.\n\nUsing the DPA in a dispute over AI guardrails would mark a significant expansion of the law’s modern use. It would also reflect an expansion of a broader pattern of executive branch instability that has intensified in recent years, according to Dean Ball, senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation and former senior policy advisor on AI in Trump’s White House.\n\n“It would basically be the government saying, ‘If you disagree with us politically, we’re going to try to put you out of business,’” Ball said.\n\nThe dispute unfolds against a backdrop of ideological friction, with some in the administration — including AI czar David Sacks — publicly criticizingAnthropic’s safety policies as “woke.”\n\n“Any reasonable, responsible investor or corporate manager is going to look at this and think the U.S. is no longer a stable place to do business,” Ball said. “This is attacking the very core of what makes America such an important hub of global commerce. We’ve always had a stable and predictable legal system.”\n\nIt’s a serious game of chicken, and Anthropic may not be the one to blink first. According toReuters, Anthropic doesn’t plan on easing its usage restrictions.\n\nAnthropic is the only frontier AI lab with classified DOD access, according to several reports. The Department of Defense doesn’t have a backup option currently in play — though the Pentagon hasreportedlyreached a deal to use xAI’s Grok in classified systems.\n\nThat lack of redundancy may help explain the Pentagon’s aggressive posture, Ball argued.\n\n“If Anthropic canceled the contract tomorrow, it would be a serious problem for the DOD,” he told TechCrunch, noting the agency appears to be falling short of aNational Security Memorandumfrom the late Biden administration that directs federal agencies to avoid dependence on a single classified-ready frontier AI system.\n\n“The DOD has no backups. This is a single-vendor situation here,” he continued. “They can’t fix that overnight.”\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and the DOD for comment.",

As part of the changes, Apple will block the downloads of apps rated 18+ in Brazil, Australia, and Singapore, while also rolling out other features to comply with laws in Utah and Louisiana in the U.S.\n\nThe companyinformed developerson Tuesday that it’s expanding its set of “age assurance” tools, including an updated Declared Age Range API now available for beta testing.\n\nThesetools allow developers to obtain a user’s age rangewithout gaining access to the user’s personal information, like their date of birth. The need for a technical solution like this came about as more governments around the world have created laws to block or restrict certain apps like social media that can only be used by adults 18 and up.\n\nIn Brazil, for example, developers can use the Declared Age Range API to obtain the user’s age category, if the user or their parent or guardian chooses to share it.\n\nIn addition, Apple will block users in Australia, Brazil, and Singapore from downloading apps rated 18+, starting today, until they confirm they are adults. In this case, the App Store will perform the age confirmation automatically, but Apple notes that developers may still have separate compliance requirements they need to meet.\n\nAlso, developers whose games contain loot boxes — a gambling-like mechanism that lets players spend money for a random chance at in-game rewards and that lawmakers believe shouldn’t be available to kids — will see their apps’ age ratings updated to reflect an 18+ audience in Brazil, specifically.\n\nIn the U.S., new users in Utah and Louisiana will soon have their age categories shared with their developers’ apps through the Declared Age Range API as well. The company said it has expanded its other tools around age ratings and permissions to meet its compliance obligations.\n\n“New signals are now available through the Declared Age Range API, including whether age-related regulatory requirements apply to the user and if the user is required to share their age range,” reads the Apple blog post. “The API will also let you know if you need to get a parent or guardian’s permission for significant app updates for a child.”\n\nApple last October worked to comply with similar age-assurance requirements in Texas butput some of its plans on hold back in December,as the state’s law is being fought in court. It alsoupdated its age ratings system last yearwith more granular age ranges than before and added a variety of new questions for developers submitting apps to Apple for review.",

      "content": "Prosecutors in a lawsuit focused on whether or not social media apps, like Instagram, are addictive and harmful, wanted to know why it took so long for Meta to roll out basic safety tools, like a nudity filter for private messages sent to teens. In April 2024, Metaintroduceda feature that would automatically blur explicit images in Instagram DMs — something the company reportedly understood to be an issue nearly six years prior.\n\nIn a newly unsealed deposition in a federal lawsuit, Instagram head Adam Mosseri was asked about an August 2018 email chain with Meta VP and Chief Information Security OfficerGuy Rosen, where he mentioned that “horrible” things could happen via Instagram private messages, also known as DMs. Those horrible things could include dick pics, the plaintiff’s lawyer said, and Mosseri agreed.\n\nHowever, the Meta exec pushed back at the line of questioning that suggested the company should have informed parents that its messaging system wasn’t monitored, beyond removing CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material).\n\n“I think that it’s pretty clear that you can message problematic content in any messaging app, whether it’s Instagram or otherwise,” Mosseri said. He said the company tried to balance people’s interest in privacy with its own interests in safety.\n\nThe testimony also revealed new stats about harmful activity on Instagram, revealing that 19.2% of survey respondents ages 13 to 15 said they had seen nudity or sexual images on Instagram that they didn’t want to see. In addition, 8.4% of 13- to 15-year-olds said they had seen someone harm themselves or threaten to do so on Instagram over the past seven days they used the app.\n\nWhile a nudity filter is only one of several updates that have been added to Instagram in recent years to protect teens, prosecutors were more interested in its delay to act, rather than whether the app is safer for teens now.\n\nMosseri was also questioned on other topics, like an email from a Facebook intern in 2017, who said that he wanted to find “addicted” Facebook users and figure out if there were ways to help them.\n\nThe 2018 email chain was meant to serve as one example that Meta was aware of the risks to minors, but it took the company until 2024 to release a product that addressed the problem of sexual images sent to teens. This includes those images sent by adults who may have engaged in grooming, a process in which an adult builds trust with a minor over time to manipulate or sexually exploit them.\n\nReached for comment, Meta spokesperson Liza Crenshaw pointed to the other ways the company has worked to keep teens safe over the years, noting that, “for over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most. We use these insights to make meaningful changes—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better,” she said.\n\nThe deposition provided by Mosseri took place during one of what are nowseveral lawsuitslooking to hold big tech accountable for harming teens. Thisparticular case, taking place in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, involves plaintiffs alleging that social media platforms are defective because they’re designed to maximize screen time, which encourages addictive behavior in teens. The defendants include Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube (Google).\n\nSimilar lawsuits are also underwayin the Los Angeles County Superior Courtandin New Mexico.\n\nLawyers across the cases are hoping to prove that the big tech companies prioritized the need for user growth and increased engagement over the potential harms impacting their youngest users.\n\nThe timing of these trials comes amid a growing number of laws restricting social media teen use, both in several U.S. states and abroad.\n\nUpdated after publication with Meta’s comment.",

(We question the audio quality, since all the tech is crammed into the lid of this tiny urn.)\n\nAccording to Spotify, the urn offers “the world’s first ever music-streaming urn,” making death “a lot less boring.” With this product, the idea is that even the dearly departed can keep jamming to their favorite tunes for eternity, or at least that’s the company’s joke.\n\n“Life needs music. So does the afterlife. That’s why Spotify has partnered with Liquid Death to create the Eternal Playlist Urn, the world’s first wireless speaker designed to bring your music somewhere it’s never been before,” Spotifystatedin a blog post.\n\nWhen you get the urn, you can create your ownEternal Playliston Spotify by answering questions like “What’s your eternal vibe?” or “What’s your go-to ghost noise?” Spotify will then use your answers and listening history to generate a custom playlist, which syncs directly to the urn’s speaker and can be shared with friends and family.\n\nWhile Spotify hasn’t released a branded smart speaker, it partnered withIkeain 2022 on a portable Bluetooth lamp speaker with Spotify Tap functionality, making this the company’s second hardware collaboration with another brand. The company also released “Car Thing,” an in-car entertainment device, which was laterdiscontinued.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Liquid Death has pushed the limits of extreme marketing. The brand is known for its outrageous campaigns, including alife-sized Yeti Casket-shaped cooler. While some may find the humor a little morbid, fans of dark, irreverent comedy seem to be intrigued by it. The cooler had over 800 bidders and sold for $68,200.\n\nWhether you view this as a clever stunt, a funny gag, a tasteless joke, or simply absurd, the Eternal Playlist Urn is a testament to how far brands will go to capture our attention.",

VCs say thatdurable growthis far more important than ultra-speedy growth. Investors want to back companies where the rate at which customers cancel or stop paying is low, meaning customers are happy. They want that annual or monthly recurring revenue to stick around and grow, not wobble and crash.\n\nEven so, the phenomenon is real. As part of Stripe’s annual report,releasedon Tuesday, the payments giant revealed that it had more new businesses start using its products in 2025 than ever before, with more than half — specifically 57% — outside the United States. This 2025 cohort grew 50% faster than those who started using Stripe products in 2024, it said. While Stripe did not reveal the hard numbers, it did say that 2025 saw double the number of these fledging startups hit $10 million in ARR within three months compared to the number that did so in 2024.\n\nThe letter also noted that Stripe Atlas —  the company’s business incorporation tool  — saw a 41% increase in company formations last year.

The company made headlines in 2023 whenit announced that it was offeringup to $20 million for zero-days in Android devices and iPhones, and later announced thatit was offering up to $4 millionfor zero-days in Telegram. The companyclaimsto work exclusively with the Russian government and local organizations.\n\nThe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said that Operation Zero’s customers “could use the tools to launch ransomware attacks or engage in other malign activities.”\n\nThe Treasury said it’s also sanctioning the company’s founder, Sergey Zelenyuk, who officials accused of selling exploits to foreign intelligence agencies and who say he sought to develop spyware and hacking technologies. The Treasury said Zelenyuk engaged in recruiting hackers and developing relationships with foreign intelligence agencies through social media. (Operation Zero has accounts on both X and Telegram.)\n\nAccording to the Treasury, Operation Zero acquired “at least eight proprietary cyber tools, which were created for the exclusive use of the U.S. government and select allies and which were stolen from a U.S. company,” and then “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.”\n\nThe Treasury said that the sanctions against Operation Zero and Zelenyuk coincide with an FBI investigation into Peter Williams, who worked for U.S. defense contractor L3Harris. In October, Williamspleaded guilty to selling at least eight of the company’s exploitsto an unspecified Russian broker.\n\nThe Treasury now says that the broker was Operation Zero, something that the government had not previously confirmed.\n\nContact UsDo you have more information about Operation Zero? Or the market for zero-days? We’d love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, orby email.\n\nWilliams was the general manager at Trenchant, which develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and some of its top intelligence partners, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom — the so-called alliance of Five Eyes countries.\n\nThe Treasury did not respond to a series of questions related to today’s sanctions.\n\nAlong with taking action against Zelenyuk, the U.S. Treasury is sanctioning an affiliate company based in the United Arab Emirates called Special Technology Services, as well as Zelenyuk’s assistant, Marina Evgenyevna Vasanovich, and two people associated with the company, Azizjon Makhmudovich Mamashoyev and Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, who have allegedly worked with Operation Zero.\n\nOperation Zero, Special Technology Services, and Zelenyuk are being sanctioned in parallel undera 2022 federal lawthat allows the U.S. government to impose sanctions on someone who committed “significant thefts of trade secrets,” per the Treasury.\n\nThe Treasury says Kucherov, a Russian national, is suspected of being a member of the prolific ransomware gangTrickBot, whose alleged members werepreviouslysanctionedby the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\n\nMamashoyev is allegedly the founder of Advance Security Solutions, another zero-day broker based in the UAE, which was also sanctioned today.\n\nAdvance Security Solutionslaunched last year, offering up to $20 million for zero-days that could help hack into any type of smartphone with a text message. The broker also offered high-paying bounties for hacking tools in popular software and hardware like Android devices, iPhones, Windows, and Chrome.\n\nOperation Zero and Zelenyuk did not respond to a request for comment. Kucherov, Mamashoyev, and Vasanovich could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nWhen contacted by TechCrunch, a person operating an Advance Security Solutions’ chat account claimed without evidence that Mamashoyev is not the founder of the company.",

Real-world data drawn from the vehicles’ onboard computers shows that’s often not the case.\n\nUsing that data, the Fraunhofer Institute could determine how much of that energy came from charging when plugged in. Itfound thatless than a third of 1 million PHEVs in Germany plugged in either occasionally or not at all.\n\nU.S. automakers that are pushing future PHEV models as appealing alternatives for American drivers should take note. By blending gas with electricity, these automakers hope to boost fleet-wide efficiency without a wide rollout of EVs.\n\n“We’re looking to make CO2reductions across our lineup, but we’re doing it in a very efficient way,” Ford CEO Jim Farleysaid this monthin an earnings call.\n\nYet the new study shows that PHEVs seldom deliver on their efficiency promises.\n\nAt best, Toyota drivers used electricity for 44% of the energy used for driving, suggesting they plugged in the most frequently. The worst? Porsche drivers, at just 0.8%, an average of 7 kilowatt-hours over two years. In other words, the average Porsche PHEV driver charged their battery less than 50% of its capacity — once.\n\nStudies have previously shown that PHEVs produce about3.5 times more emissionsthan their official ratings would suggest. This new study explains why since it directly assesses how much electricity the vehicles gained from charging. (PHEVs, like all hybrids, can operate in a mixed mode, using both gas and electricity. The study used data straight off the vehicles to disentangle the two.)\n\nOne of PHEV’s many shortcomings are their anemic batteries, capable of powering the vehicle for short distances. Some can only traverse a handful of miles, while many sold in recent years can operate on battery power for about 20 to 30 miles. Regulators in Europe and automakers have been proposing longer ranges for future models, hoping that a more capable battery will encourage people to charge their batteries more frequently.\n\nThat’s not guaranteed, though. The vehicles are likely to remain compromised when driving on electrons. That’s because most PHEVs are based on fossil fuel platforms — the electric motors and power electronics aren’t capable of delivering 100% of the vehicle’s power needs. When a driver floors it, the gas engine has to kick in. In other vehicles, the engine turns on in cold weather to heat the cabin. When that happens, “why bother plugging in” is apparently a question most PHEV drivers have asked themselves.\n\nWhich raises another question: Why bother with PHEVs at all?\n\nPHEVs have been touted as a way to ease cautious consumers into full EVs. The argument goes something like this: Drivers will become habituated with plugging in while EV charging networks are built out. By the time they’re ready for their next vehicle, the networks will be ready and customers can ease into an EV.\n\nBut if nobody is plugging in their PHEVs, they’re definitely not developing the habit. Without full charges, the electric drivetrain isn’t benefiting anyone. The public still suffers from worse air pollution, and drivers are carting around hundreds of pounds of weight and enduringmore recallsand costlier service visits as a result of the complex drivetrain.\n\nTweaking the PHEV formula to make them more reliant on batteries could help. The interim solution is called an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), and it’s designed to run on battery power until the charge is depleted, at which point the fossil fuel engine recharges it. So far, no EREV has required the owner to plug in — they could easily drive the vehicle for its lifetime on gas. BMW used to make an EREV in the i3, but it stopped production years ago. Ford and Stellantis have both announced EREV pickup trucks, which have yet to go on sale.\n\nMeanwhile, EV charging networkscontinue to expand. It’s possible that by the time automakers are making PHEVs and EREVs in large quantities, drivers will no longer need a comfort blanket in the form of a gas engine. (My household came to that conclusion two years ago. After a decade split between a BMW i3 EREV and a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid PHEV, we traded up for a Kia EV9.)\n\nLegacy automakers, which have second-guessed their electrification strategies more times than I care to count, could be forced to change tack once more.\n\nPHEVs might have been a nifty solution on paper, but they’ve failed to deliver in the real world.",

      "content": "Tech giants’ efforts to ramp up AI adoption in India may be about to hit a turning point, as companies end free promotions with hopes to convert the world’s fourth-largest economy into a windfall of paid subscribers.\n\nIndia became the world’s largest market for generative AI app downloads in 2025, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, widening its lead over the U.S. as installs jumped 207% year-over-year.\n\nCompanies includingOpenAI,Google, andPerplexityrolled out extended free premium offers to accelerate user growth in the price sensitive market. Leading AI firms have also backed India in its push to become a global artificial intelligence hub. Amajor AI summit in New Delhilast week wasattended by leadersincluding OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai — a sign of the country’s growing weight in the global AI race.\n\nNow, some of those early promotional pushes are winding down. Perplexityendedits bundled Pro offer with Indian telco Airtel in January, while OpenAI’s free ChatGPT Go access in India isno longer available, potentially setting the stage for a clearer test of how many newly acquired users convert to paying subscribers.\n\nDespite strong download growth, India still generates a disproportionately small share of AI app revenue, accounting for about 1% of in-app purchases even as it drives roughly 20% of global GenAI app downloads, according to the Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch, highlighting the monetization challenge in one of the industry’s fastest-growing markets.\n\nGenAI app adoption in India accelerated sharply through 2025, with downloads peaking in September and October at year-over-year growth rates of about 320% and 260%, respectively, according to the data. Yet the surge in usage did not fully translate into revenue gains. In November and December 2025, AI app in-app purchase revenue in India fell 22% and 18% month over month, respectively. ChatGPT’s revenue dropped even more sharply — down 33% and 32% over the same period following the November launch of free sub-$5 ChatGPT Go access — reflecting the near-term impact of aggressive promotional pushes.\n\nChatGPT still commands more than 60% of GenAI in-app revenue in India, meaning shifts in its pricing strategy can significantly influence overall market performance.\n\nAlongside promotional pushes, Sensor Tower attributed the surge in GenAI app adoption in India last year to a mix of new product launches, including the debut of platforms such as DeepSeek, Grok, and Meta AI, as well asupgrades to major chatbotslike ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity. Viral interest in AI-generated content also helped fuel adoption, with content creation and editing tools accounting for seven of the 20 most downloaded GenAI apps in India in 2025.\n\nThe user surge has been equally pronounced. India accounted for about 19% of the global user base of leading AI assistant apps in 2025, ahead of the U.S. at 10%, Sensor Tower said. ChatGPT continues to dominate the Indian market by monthly active users, though rivals including Google’s Gemini and Perplexity have also seen rapid growth following promotional offers. ChatGPT was themost downloaded GenAI appin India and globally in 2025, according to earlier Sensor Tower data. Earlier this month, OpenAI’s CEO said that the chatbot now hasmore than 100 million weekly active usersin India.\n\nThe promotional push in India reflects a broader strategy by AI firms to reduce pricing friction in a highly value-conscious market, betting that early user adoption and engagement will translate into stronger long-term retention once free access periods expire, said Sneha Pandey, insights analyst at Sensor Tower.\n\nIndia’s appeal lies in its massive digital base. The country has more than a billion internet users and around 700 million smartphone owners, making it one of the largest potential markets for AI services globally and a critical battleground for user growth.\n\nNonetheless, user engagement in India still trails more mature markets. In 2025, users of leading AI chatbot apps in the U.S. spent about 21% more time per week on the apps than their counterparts in India and logged 17% more sessions on average, per Sensor Tower.\n\n“AI in-app revenues will likely see meaningful but gradual improvement as users become more deeply integrated into these platforms, making sustained engagement paramount,” Pandey told TechCrunch.\n\nShe added that pricing pressure in India is likely to remain elevated given the country’s young and value-conscious user base, making lower-cost tiers, telecom bundles, and micro-transaction models important for long-term retention.\n\nChatGPT remained the clear market leader in India entering 2026, with 180 million monthly active users in January, per Sensor Tower, followed by Google’s Gemini with 118 million, Perplexity with 19 million, and Meta AI with 12 million. The figures underline both the scale of India’s AI opportunity and the growing challenge for firms to convert rapid user adoption into sustained revenue.\n\nGoogle, OpenAI, and Perplexity did not respond to requests for comments.",
