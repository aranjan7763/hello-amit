OpenAI and Anthropic are selling directly to enterprises. Every SaaS vendor now ships an AI assistant.\n\nIn the scramble for the interface, Glean is betting on something less visible: becoming the intelligence layer beneath it.\n\nSeven years ago, Glean set out to be the Google for enterprise — an AI-powered search tool designed to index and search across a company’s SaaS tool library, from Slack to Jira, Google Drive to Salesforce. Today, the company’s strategy has shifted from building a better enterprise chatbot to becoming the connective tissue between models and enterprise systems.\n\n“The layer we built initially – a good search product – required us to deeply understand people and how they work and what their preferences are,” Jain told TechCrunch on last week’sepisode of Equity, which we recorded at Web Summit Qatar. “All of that is now becoming foundational in terms of building high quality agents.”\n\nHe says that while large language models are powerful, they’re also generic.\n\n“The AI models themselves don’t really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don’t know who the different people are, they don’t know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.”\n\nGlean’s pitch is that it already maps that context and can sit between the model and the enterprise data.\n\nThe Glean Assistant is often the entry point for customers — a familiar chat interface powered by a mix of leading proprietary (ie, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models, grounded in the company’s internal data. But what keeps customers, Jain argues, is everything underneath it.\n\nFirst is model access. Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to sw",

Altman isattending the eventalongside senior executives from several of the world’s leading AI companies.\n\nThe growth comes as OpenAI,like other leading AI firms, looks to India’s young population and its more than a billion internet users to fuel global expansion. The ChatGPT makeropened a New Delhi officein August 2025 after months of groundwork in the country, and has adjusted its approach for India’s price-sensitive market, including rolling out asub-$5 ChatGPT Go tierthat waslater made free for a yearfor Indian users.\n\nIn the article, Altman said India is ChatGPT’s second-largest user base after the United States, highlighting the South Asian nation’s growing weight in OpenAI’s global strategy. The disclosure comes as ChatGPT’s overall usage has surged worldwide, with the platformreaching 800 million weekly active usersas of October 2025 and reported to beapproaching 900 million.\n\nAltman also highlighted the role of students in driving adoption, saying India has the largest number of student users of ChatGPT globally.\n\nIndian students have become a key growth segment for leading AI companies more broadly, as rivals race to embed their tools in classrooms and learning workflows. Google has similarly targeted the market, offering Indian students afree one-year subscription to its AI Pro planin September 2025. Separately, India accounts for thehighest global usage of Gemini for learning, Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, said last month.\n\n“With its focus on access, practical Al literacy, and the infrastructure that ",

Even as overall college enrollmentclimbed 2% nationally— according to January data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center — students are bailing on traditional CS degrees.\n\nThe one exception is UC San Diego  — the only UC campus that added adedicated AI major this fall.\n\nThis all might look like a temporary blip tied to news about fewer CS gradsfinding work out of college. But it’s more likely an indicator of the future, one that China is much more enthusiastically embracing. As MIT Technology Reviewreported last July, Chinese universities have leaned hard into AI literacy, treating AI not as a threat but instead as essential infrastructure. Nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty now use AI tools multiple times daily, and schools like Zhejiang University have made AI coursework mandatory, while top institutions like Tsinghua have created entirely new interdisciplinary AI colleges. In China, fluency with AI isn’t optional anymore; it’s table stakes.\n\nU.S. universities are scrambling to catch up. Over the last two years, dozens have launched AI-specific programs. MIT’s “AI and decision-making” major is now thesecond-largest majoron campus, says the school. Asreportedby the New York Times in December, the University of South Florida enrolled more than3,000 studentsin anew AI and cybersecurity collegeduring its fall semester.

And that was why I started looking through these files, in part because a long time ago, flashback 10 years ago on my beat especially, there was just a ton of Chinese investment in the space.\n\nThis was before even the rush of EV startups in China that we see today […] In autonomous vehicles, but electric vehicles especially, there was this moment where Chinese investors and Chinese companies, state-owned automakers, all they wanted to do was to be looked at like Silicon Valley startups. So they came here and they invested in companies and helped get them off the ground, or in some cases even set up offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nAnd it was in that environment that a lot of the companies that I’ve covered for a long time popped up. There was just never a full picture of how a lot of them were funded.\n\nOne in particular, this company called Canoo, which is now bankrupt and out of business, had maybe the most mysterious set of investors of all of them. They really were not upfront about it when they first sort of came out of stealth in early 2018. And it frankly took until there was a lawsuit between some people who ran the company near the top ",

Launched in 2023, the accelerator has an acceptance rate of less than 1%. In aJanuary blog post,the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort.\n\nThe program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on.\n\nThere are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The programinvests up to $1 millioninto each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors.\n\nIn comparison, Y Combinatortypically takes a fixed 7%of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 “invested on an uncapped MFN safe.”\n\nSpeedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel.\n\nGiven the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications forthe next cohort open in April,though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said.\n\nSpeedrun focuses on early-stage startups. Becau",

Then, a close friend of his met their partner via Date Drop. “That was when I got the sense that this was less of a project,” he said.\n\nNow, Weng thinks of Date Drop as just the first service from his startup, TheRelationship Company, which is a public benefit corporation — a type of company legally required to consider social impact alongside profits.\n\n“This started as something I just wanted to exist on campus, and it became a company because people kept on asking for it in their schools and I needed resources to do that,” he said.\n\nAlready, Weng has raised “a few million” from some angel investors, including Zynga founder and early Facebook backer Mark Pincus, who has taught business courses at Stanford (including to Weng).
