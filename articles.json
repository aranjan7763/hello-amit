      "content": "Salesforce pulled out all the stops to convince investors that the AI revolution won’t be its death when it announced fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\n\nSalesforce reported a solid quarter of $10.7 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year. For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition ofdata management companyInformaticalast May.\n\nNet income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.\n\nThe numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, withSalesforce as their poster child, have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seatbusiness models obsolete. The situation has been dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse.”\n\nThe concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.\n\n“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”\n\nIn an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).\n\nThe company also revamped the earnings call itself. It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.\n\nInstead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja; the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts; and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: They all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.\n\nSalesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: agentic work units (“AWU”). The idea here is that instead of simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but reallyis notin the AI world.)\n\n“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce president and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable piece of work.\n\nOn top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itselfowning most of the tech stack, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.\n\nThis was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, afterOpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data)on the bottom as the unseen engines.\n\nAnd if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.",

The company reported $215 billion in revenue for the full year.\n\nAs in previous quarters, the company did not report any revenue from chip exports to China, despite the recent lifting of export restrictions by the U.S. government. “While small amounts of H200 products for China-based customers were approved by the U.S. government, they have yet to generate any revenue, and we do not know whether any imports will be allowed into China,” Colette Kress, the company’s chief financial officer, said.\n\n“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress,” she continued, in an apparent reference toMoore Threads’ IPO in December, “and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term.”\n\nDuring the investor call, Huang also addressed the company’s pending investment in OpenAI, which has beenreported at $30 billion.\n\n“We continue to work with OpenAI toward a partnership agreement. We believe we are close,” Huang said. He also referenced partnerships with Anthropic, Meta, and Elon Musk’s xAI. However,statements Nvidia filedwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday emphasized that there was “no assurance” an investment would take place.\n\nHuang also addressed concerns about the sustainability oftech companies’ capex commitments, saying he believed the compute investments would soon bring revenue.\n\n“In this new world of AI, computeisrevenue. Without compute, there’s no way to generate tokens. Without tokens, there’s no way to grow revenues,” Huang said. “We’ve reached the inflection point and we’re generating profitable tokens that are productive for customers and profitable for the cloud service providers”",

      "content": "Anthropic on Wednesdayannouncedthat it has acquired Vercept, an AI startup with deep roots to some of the biggest names in Seattle’s tech scene. The acquisition marks the latest after Anthropicacquired coding agent engine Bunin December to help scale Claude Code.\n\nVercept had created tools for more complex agentic tasks, including its product Vy, a computer-use agent in the cloud that could operate a remote Apple MacBook. Vercept is one of the many startups working on re-imagining the personal computer for the age of AI agents. As part of the deal, Anthropic is shuttering Vercept’s product on March 25.\n\nThe startup was a grad of Seattle’s AI-focusedincubatorA12,which spawned from the longstanding Allen Institute for AI. Vercept’s co-founders had roots with the Allen Institute, as well, and were previously researchers there. One co-founder, Matt Deitke, made news last year as one of the AI researcherswho negotiated a monster $250 million salaryfrom Meta to join its Superintelligence Lab. On Wednesday, Deitke congratulated his former colleaguesin a post on X.\n\nCongrats to@ehsanik,@LucaWeihs, and@inkynumbers!Happy for you all :) 🚀https://t.co/n3WTq4CAAs\n\nVercept was a relatively high-profile AI startup in the region. In aLinkedIn postannouncing the acquisition by Anthropic, Vercept CEO Kiana Ehsani said the startup had raised a total of $50 million. She called out A12’s Seth Bannon, a board member, as the lead investor. Vercept previously announced it had raised a$16 million seed roundlast January.\n\nThe list of angel investors was impressive, too, and included former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, and Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi,GeekWire reported.\n\nIn Anthropic’s announcement of the acquisition, the company named co-founders Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick as some of the team brought on to join Anthropic in the acquisition. However, not all of Vercept’s co-founders are joining the Claude maker.\n\nOren Etzioni, who haspreviously been namedas a co-founder of Vercept and investor in the startup, is well known in Seattle as the founding leader of the Allen Institute for AI. Along with Deitke, he is also not joining Anthropic, and was vocally less pleased about the acqui-hire. He postedon LinkedIn: “After a little bit more than a year,Verceptis throwing in the towel and giving their customers 30 days to get off the platform. Sad. A fantastic team is joining Anthropic. I wish them the very best!”\n\nEtzioni is also a professor at the University of Washington and known forother startupshe’s founded and backed as a VC. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Etzioni’s LinkedIn post, he accused Bannon, the Vercept lead investor, of being “partly responsible” for Vercept not hiring the correct business people. A back and forth ensued between the investors, withBannon condemningEtzioni’s remarks: “… you disparaged the heroic work of the founders for achieving an outcome most could only dream of,” Bannon replied in the LinkedIn string. They also accused each other of other less savory things like lying and legal threats.\n\nWhile public spats between investors are entertaining, and essentially meaningless, the underlying motivation is notable. The stakes are high to build the next big AI winner, and now a promising startup that raised a decently sized war chest will be tucked into Anthropic.\n\nWhile the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Etzioni says he got a return on his money. Anthropic clearly wanted these researchers (perhaps — especially — with another of them at Meta).\n\nStill, Etzioni told GeekWire that he remains bummed. “I’m pleased to have gotten a positive return but obviously disappointed that after just a little over a year with so much traction, and such a fantastic team, we’re basically throwing in the towel,” he said.\n\nThe founders joining Anthropic, however, appear happy, according to CEO’s Ehsani’s LinkedIn post. “The choices were clear: we could build independently and work toward the same vision as two separate versions of it, or join forces with an incredible team and accelerate that vision into reality. The decision became an easy choice,” she said of joining Anthropic.",

      "content": "A veteran cybersecurity executive who prosecutors said “betrayed” the United States will spend at least the next seven years behind bars, after pleading guilty to stealing and selling hacking and surveillance tools to a Russian firm.\n\nPeter Williams, a former executive at U.S. defense contractor L3Harris,was sentenced on Tuesday to 87 months in prisonfor leaking his former company’s trade secrets in exchange for $1.3 million in crypto between 2022 and 2025. Williams sold the exploits to Operation Zero, which the U.S. government calls “one of the world’s most nefarious exploit brokers.”\n\nThe successful conviction of Williams follows one of the most high-profile leaks of sensitive Western-made hacking tools in recent years. Even now that the case is over, there are still unanswered questions.\n\nWilliams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resided in Washington, D.C., was the general manager of Trenchant, the division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and its closest global intelligence partners. Prosecutors sayWilliams took advantage of having “full access” to the company’s secure networksto download the hacking tools onto a portable hard drive, and later to his computer. Williams contacted Operation Zero under a pseudonym though, so it’s unclear if Operation Zero ever knew Williams’ real identity.\n\nTrenchant is a crew of hackers and bug hunters who dig deep into other popular software made by companies like Google and Apple, identify flaws in those millions of lines of code, then devise techniques to turn those flaws into workable exploits that can be used to reliably hack into those products. These tools are typically calledzero-dayexploits because they take advantage of software flaws unknown to its developer, whichcan be worth millions of dollars.\n\nTheU.S. Department of Justice allegedthat the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed whoever used them to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.”\n\nFor the past few months, I have been talking to sources and reporting on Williams’ story before news broke thathe had been arrested. But what I had heard was patchwork and at times conflicting. I had heard someone had been arrested, but given the secret nature of the work involved in exploit development, proving it would be challenging.\n\nContact UsDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, orby email.\n\nWhen I first heard of Williams, I wasn’t clear that I had even gotten his name right. At that point, his story was a rumor, moving through the hush-hush grapevine of zero-day exploit developers, sellers, and people with ties to the intelligence community.\n\nI heard that maybe he was called John, or perhaps Duggan? Or all the different ways you can spell that in English.\n\nSome of the first rumors I heard were contradictory. Apparently he stole zero-days from Trenchant, and maybe he sold them to Russia, or perhaps another enemy of the United States and its allies, like North Korea or China?\n\nIt took weeks just to confirm that there was indeed someone who even fit that description. (It turned out that Williams’ middle name is John, and Doogie is his nickname in hacker circles.)\n\nThen, as the weeks of reporting rolled on, things started to become much clearer.\n\nAsI first revealed in October, Trenchant fired an employee after Williams, who was still at the time head of Trenchant, accused the employee of stealing and leaking Chrome zero-days. The story was even more intriguing because the employee told me that after he was fired, Apple notified him that someone had targeted his personal iPhone.\n\nWhat I learned was just the tip of the iceberg. I had heard more from my sources, but we were still piecing parts of the story together.\n\nSoon after, prosecutors made their first formal accusation against a man named Peter Williams for stealing trade secrets, which first surfaced in the U.S. public court system. In that first court document, prosecutors confirmed that the buyer of these trade secrets was a buyer in Russia.\n\nHowever, there was no explicit reference to L3Harris nor Trenchant, nor the fact that the trade secrets that Williams stole were zero-days. Crucially, we still couldn’t confirm for certain that it was the same Peter Williams, who we thought would have access to highly sensitive exploits as Trenchant’s boss, and not some terrible case of mistaken identity.\n\nWestillweren’t there.\n\nOn a hunch and with nothing to lose, we contacted the Department of Justice to ask if they would confirm that the person in the document was in fact Peter Williams, the former boss of L3Harris Trenchant. A spokesperson confirmed.\n\nFinally,the story was out. A week later, Williams pleaded guilty.\n\nWhen I first heard of his story, while I trusted my sources, I remained skeptical. Why would someone like Williams do what the rumors claimed? But he did, and did so for money, prosecutors allege, which Williams then used to buy a house, jewelry, and luxury watches.\n\nIt was a remarkable fall from grace for Williams, once seen as an accomplished and brilliant hacker, and especially for someone who previously worked at Australia’s top foreign spy agency and served in the country’s military.\n\nWe still don’t know specifically which exploits and hacking tools Williams stole and sold. Trenchant estimated a loss of $35 million, per court documents. But Williams’ lawyers said the stolen tools were not classified as a government secret.\n\nWe can glean some insight based on the circumstances of the case.\n\nGiven that the Justice Department said the stolen tools could be used to hack “millions of computers and devices,” it’s likely the tools refer to zero-days in popular consumer software, such as Android devices, Apple’s iPhones and iPads, and web browsers.\n\nThere is some evidence pointing in their direction. During a hearing last year, prosecutors read out louda post published on Xby Operation Zero,according to independent cybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter, who attended the hearing.\n\n“Due to high demand on the market, we’re increasing payouts for top-tier mobile exploits,” read the post, which specifically mentioned Android and iOS. “As always, the end user is a non-NATO country.”\n\nOperation Zerooffers millions of dollarsfor details of security vulnerabilities in Android devices and iPhones, messaging appslike Telegram, as well asother kinds of software, such as Microsoft Windows, and hardware vendors, such as several brands of servers and routers.\n\nOperation Zeroclaimsto work with the Russian government. At the time Williams sold the exploits to the Russian broker, Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was already underway.\n\nOn the same day that Williams was sentenced, the U.S. Treasuryannounced it had imposed sanctionsagainst Operation Zero and its founder Sergey Zelenyuk, calling the company a national security threat. This was the government’s first confirmation that Williams had sold the exploits to Operation Zero.\n\nIn its statement, the Treasury said the broker “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” At this point we don’t know who this user is. The user could be a foreign intelligence service, or it could be a ransomware gang, given that the Treasury also sanctioned Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, an alleged member of the Trickbot gang, who also allegedly worked with Operation Zero.\n\nIn a court document, prosecutors said that L3Harris was able to figure out that “an unauthorized vendor was selling a component” of one of the stolen trade secrets “by comparing company-specific vendor data found on a stolen component that matched.”\n\nProsecutors also said that Williams “recognized code he wrote and sold” to Operation Zero “being utilized by a South Korean broker,” further suggesting that both L3Harris and prosecutors know which tools were stolen and sold to Operation Zero.\n\nAnother unanswered question is: Did anyone, either the U.S. government or L3Harris, alert Apple, Google, or whichever tech company’s products were affected by the zero-day flaws, now that the exploits had leaked?\n\nAny company or developer would want to know that someone could have used (or could still use) a zero-day against their users and customers so that they can patch the flaws as soon as possible. And at this point, the zero-days are of no use for L3Harris and its government customers.\n\nWhen I asked Apple and Google, neither company responded to my inquiries. L3Harris did not respond either.\n\nThen there’s the mystery of the scapegoat, who was fired after Williams accused him of stealing and leaking code.\n\nAt sentencing, Justice Department prosecutorsconfirmedthat the employee was fired, saying Williams “stood idly by while another employee of the company was essentially blamed for [his] own conduct.” In response, Williams’ attorney rebuffed prosecutors, claiming that the former employee “was fired for misconduct,” citing claims of dual-employment and improper handling of the company’s intellectual property.\n\nAccording to a court document submitted by Williams’ lawyers, as part of the L3Harris internal investigation, the company placed the employee on leave, seized his devices, transferred them to the U.S., and “offered them to the FBI.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, an unnamed FBI spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add apart from the Justice Department’spress release.\n\nAfter being fired, that employee, whom we identified with the alias Jay Gibson, received a notification from Apple that his personal iPhone was targeted “with a mercenary spyware attack.”\n\nApplesendsthesenotificationsto users it thinks were the target of attacks using tools like those made by NSO Group or Intellexa.\n\nWho tried to hack Gibson? He received the notification on March 5, 2025, more than six months after the FBI investigation had begun. The FBI “regularly interacted with [Williams] in late 2024 through the summer of 2025,”according to a court document.\n\nGiven the nature of the leaked tools, it is plausible that the FBI, or perhaps even a U.S. intelligence agency, targeted Gibson as part of the investigation into Williams’ leaks. But we just don’t know, and there’s a chance that neither the public, nor Gibson, will ever find out.\n\nUpdated to clarify 22nd paragraph attributing the tools’ lack of classification to Williams’ lawyers.",

They have already made public commitments in recent weeks to cover electricity costs by building their own power sources, paying higher rates, or both, part of a broader effort to solve PR problems around data center expansion and win over skeptical communities.\n\nOn January 11, Microsoftannouncedits policy “to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our datacenters is not passed on to residential customers.” On January 26, OpenAIcommittedto “paying its own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your energy prices.” On February 11, Anthropic made thesame pledgeto “cover electricity price increases that consumers face from our data centers.” Yesterday, Googleannouncedthe largest battery project in the world to support a data center in Minnesota.\n\nWhat these commitments mean in practice, and who will determine which data centers are responsible for which price increases, remains unknown. The White House has not released the text of the proposed pledge.\n\n“A handshake agreement with Big Tech over data center costs isn’t good enough,” Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kellysaidon social media. “Americans need a guarantee that energy prices won’t soar and communities have a say.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Taylor Rodgerssaidthat next week, companies will send representatives to formally sign the pledge at the White House. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, xAI, Oracle, and OpenAI are reportedly among those set to attend. However, none of the companies have confirmed their attendance.\n\nEven if tech companies commit to taking on electricity costs, on-site power plants may not be a panacea — they can still have adverse impacts on thesurrounding environment, and will stress supply chains for natural gas, turbines, photovoltaics, and batteries, depending on how companies aim to power their compute.",
      "excerpt": "The proliferation of AI data centers plugging into the national electrical grid has helped increase consumer electricity prices, driving up the average national electricity price by more than 6% in the last year.\n\nThat’s not a good look for the incumbents ahead of this fall’s elections, and Presiden",

Some of these haveincluded several members of its election security team, TechCrunch reported last year. CISA is the federal agency responsible for election security.

It looked great on paper but didn’t really work in real life,” Lucena said.\n\nShe had learned firsthand that hiring is typically based on markers of success like college degrees, previous work experience, and a gut instinct. But she knew there had to be a better way. So she developed Mappa and spent years creating a proprietary dataset based on hundreds of interviews that allowed her team to analyze behavior based on biomarkers indicated through people’s speech patterns. Through this process, the Mappa team found that to make the right hire the first time, a candidate can’t just be great on paper; they also have to be compatible.\n\n“There’s no trait that’s good or bad inherently; it’s more of what environment do you put that person in, and what roles are better aligned with people’s sort of tendencies and styles. So that’s how we’ve been thinking about defining compatibility,” Lucena said in the podcast interview.\n\nMappa is powered by an all Latinx team that knows how frustrating it is to be overlooked based on superficial biases or a lack of the “correct” experiences. She describes them as underdogs that understand this problem on a personal level.\n\n“We are all underdogs. We are all folks that have been overlooked in some degree. And I guess that makes it even more important that we are the ones building this,” Lucena said. “Having people like us building this technology, at the level we are doing, with the quality we are able to get to the market and serving our clients the way we do. It also opens up a door for others to come and join and know that there are multiple ways still to build technology.”\n\nLucena’s best advice for early-stage founders who are hiring is to take your time and be sure the compatibility is there from the beginning to avoid the hassle of hiring, firing, and rehiring for the same role.\n\nIsabelle Johannessen is our host.Build Modeis produced and edited by Maggie Nye.

      "content": "Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event in San Francisco on Wednesday saw the Korean tech giant unveil its new S26 series of Galaxy smartphones, a pair of new earbuds, and talk a lot about AI assistants and agents.\n\nHere’s a quick recap of everything announced at the event.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant has lined up three new smartphones for the year: Galaxy S26 Ultra, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26, all of which feature iterative updates compared to their predecessors.\n\nAs the flagship, the S26 Ultra comes with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, a 6.9-inch QHD+ display, and a 5,000 mAh battery. Samsung says the phone can charge from 0% to 75% in 30 minutes with a 60W charger, and supports the S-Pen stylus.\n\nSamsung said while the S26 Ultra’s wide (200-megapixel) and telephoto (50-megapixel) lenses retain the same pixel count as its predecessor, the new wide camera has a bigger aperture of f/1.4, as does the telephoto lens, with an aperture of f/2.9.\n\nThe other two phones have the same processor as the S26 Ultra, but Samsung is using its own Exynos 2600 processor for these devices in some geographies. The smaller Galaxy S26 gets a battery bump from last year’s phone, and the S26 Plus can charge wirelessly at 20W.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 starts at $899 ($100 more than last year’s model), the Galaxy S26 Plus starts at $1,099 (also $100 more from last year), and the Galaxy S26 Ultra starts at $1,200.\n\nBesides the hardware upgrades, Samsung has made a neat update to the S26 Ultra’s display thatprevents people around you from reading what’s on the phone’s screen.\n\nUsers can choose to hide certain parts of the screen, like the notification area or the password field in login forms, or all of it. The privacy display can be configured for each app.\n\nSamsung said there is a “maximum privacy protection” feature as well, which tones down bright areas and lifts up dark parts of the screen.\n\nGoogle also madetwo significant announcements at Samsung’s event. First, the search giant previewed a new agentic version of Gemini that can perform tasks on your behalf, such as hailing a cab from Uber.\n\nSamir Samat, head of Android ecosystem at Google, showed a demo where Gemini looks at a group chat and figures out the meal order that it should place on Grubhub.\n\nThe company also introduced a new version of “Circle to Search” that uses multi-object recognition to search for anything that you highlight on your phone’s display.\n\nEarlier this week, Samsung said it waspartnering with Perplexityto pre-load the AI company’s app on its smartphones and use its APIs to do stuff like set alarms or take notes, as well as power its browser’s search capabilities.\n\nSamsung’s smartphones now come with three AI assistants: Bixby, Google Gemini, and Perplexity. The company is also using Galaxy AI to screen calls and give you a summary of what the caller says.\n\nSamsung has also released two new earphones: the Galaxy Buds4 and the Galaxy Buds4 Pro. These earphones have a flatter stem design than their predecessors, and are rated IP54 and IP57, which means they are somewhat protected from dust and water.\n\nSamsung says the Buds4 Pro has a new 11mm woofer, which widens the speaker area by 20%. The Pro models also feature a slightly longer battery life without the case compared to the regular version.\n\nThe Buds4 are priced at $179 while the Buds4 Pro cost $250.",
