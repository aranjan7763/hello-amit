      "content": "A veteran cybersecurity executive who prosecutors said “betrayed” the United States will spend at least the next seven years behind bars, after pleading guilty to stealing and selling hacking and surveillance tools to a Russian firm.\n\nPeter Williams, a former executive at U.S. defense contractor L3Harris,was sentenced on Tuesday to 87 months in prisonfor leaking his former company’s trade secrets in exchange for $1.3 million in crypto between 2022 and 2025. Williams sold the exploits to Operation Zero, which the U.S. government calls “one of the world’s most nefarious exploit brokers.”\n\nThe successful conviction of Williams follows one of the most high-profile leaks of sensitive Western-made hacking tools in recent years. Even now that the case is over, there are still unanswered questions.\n\nWilliams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resided in Washington, D.C., was the general manager of Trenchant, the division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and its closest global intelligence partners. Prosecutors sayWilliams took advantage of having “full access” to the company’s secure networksto download the hacking tools onto a portable hard drive, and later to his computer. Williams contacted Operation Zero under a pseudonym though, so it’s unclear if Operation Zero ever knew Williams’ real identity.\n\nTrenchant is a crew of hackers and bug hunters who dig deep into other popular software made by companies like Google and Apple, identify flaws in those millions of lines of code, then devise techniques to turn those flaws into workable exploits that can be used to reliably hack into those products. These tools are typically calledzero-dayexploits because they take advantage of software flaws unknown to its developer, whichcan be worth millions of dollars.\n\nTheU.S. Department of Justice allegedthat the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed whoever used them to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.”\n\nFor the past few months, I have been talking to sources and reporting on Williams’ story before news broke thathe had been arrested. But what I had heard was patchwork and at times conflicting. I had heard someone had been arrested, but given the secret nature of the work involved in exploit development, proving it would be challenging.\n\nContact UsDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, orby email.\n\nWhen I first heard of Williams, I wasn’t clear that I had even gotten his name right. At that point, his story was a rumor, moving through the hush-hush grapevine of zero-day exploit developers, sellers, and people with ties to the intelligence community.\n\nI heard that maybe he was called John, or perhaps Duggan? Or all the different ways you can spell that in English.\n\nSome of the first rumors I heard were contradictory. Apparently he stole zero-days from Trenchant, and maybe he sold them to Russia, or perhaps another enemy of the United States and its allies, like North Korea or China?\n\nIt took weeks just to confirm that there was indeed someone who even fit that description. (It turned out that Williams’ middle name is John, and Doogie is his nickname in hacker circles.)\n\nThen, as the weeks of reporting rolled on, things started to become much clearer.\n\nAsI first revealed in October, Trenchant fired an employee after Williams, who was still at the time head of Trenchant, accused the employee of stealing and leaking Chrome zero-days. The story was even more intriguing because the employee told me that after he was fired, Apple notified him that someone had targeted his personal iPhone.\n\nWhat I learned was just the tip of the iceberg. I had heard more from my sources, but we were still piecing parts of the story together.\n\nSoon after, prosecutors made their first formal accusation against a man named Peter Williams for stealing trade secrets, which first surfaced in the U.S. public court system. In that first court document, prosecutors confirmed that the buyer of these trade secrets was a buyer in Russia.\n\nHowever, there was no explicit reference to L3Harris nor Trenchant, nor the fact that the trade secrets that Williams stole were zero-days. Crucially, we still couldn’t confirm for certain that it was the same Peter Williams, who we thought would have access to highly sensitive exploits as Trenchant’s boss, and not some terrible case of mistaken identity.\n\nWestillweren’t there.\n\nOn a hunch and with nothing to lose, we contacted the Department of Justice to ask if they would confirm that the person in the document was in fact Peter Williams, the former boss of L3Harris Trenchant. A spokesperson confirmed.\n\nFinally,the story was out. A week later, Williams pleaded guilty.\n\nWhen I first heard of his story, while I trusted my sources, I remained skeptical. Why would someone like Williams do what the rumors claimed? But he did, and did so for money, prosecutors allege, which Williams then used to buy a house, jewelry, and luxury watches.\n\nIt was a remarkable fall from grace for Williams, once seen as an accomplished and brilliant hacker, and especially for someone who previously worked at Australia’s top foreign spy agency and served in the country’s military.\n\nWe still don’t know specifically which exploits and hacking tools Williams stole and sold. Trenchant estimated a loss of $35 million, per court documents. But Williams’ lawyers said the stolen tools were not classified as a government secret.\n\nWe can glean some insight based on the circumstances of the case.\n\nGiven that the Justice Department said the stolen tools could be used to hack “millions of computers and devices,” it’s likely the tools refer to zero-days in popular consumer software, such as Android devices, Apple’s iPhones and iPads, and web browsers.\n\nThere is some evidence pointing in their direction. During a hearing last year, prosecutors read out louda post published on Xby Operation Zero,according to independent cybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter, who attended the hearing.\n\n“Due to high demand on the market, we’re increasing payouts for top-tier mobile exploits,” read the post, which specifically mentioned Android and iOS. “As always, the end user is a non-NATO country.”\n\nOperation Zerooffers millions of dollarsfor details of security vulnerabilities in Android devices and iPhones, messaging appslike Telegram, as well asother kinds of software, such as Microsoft Windows, and hardware vendors, such as several brands of servers and routers.\n\nOperation Zeroclaimsto work with the Russian government. At the time Williams sold the exploits to the Russian broker, Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was already underway.\n\nOn the same day that Williams was sentenced, the U.S. Treasuryannounced it had imposed sanctionsagainst Operation Zero and its founder Sergey Zelenyuk, calling the company a national security threat. This was the government’s first confirmation that Williams had sold the exploits to Operation Zero.\n\nIn its statement, the Treasury said the broker “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” At this point we don’t know who this user is. The user could be a foreign intelligence service, or it could be a ransomware gang, given that the Treasury also sanctioned Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, an alleged member of the Trickbot gang, who also allegedly worked with Operation Zero.\n\nIn a court document, prosecutors said that L3Harris was able to figure out that “an unauthorized vendor was selling a component” of one of the stolen trade secrets “by comparing company-specific vendor data found on a stolen component that matched.”\n\nProsecutors also said that Williams “recognized code he wrote and sold” to Operation Zero “being utilized by a South Korean broker,” further suggesting that both L3Harris and prosecutors know which tools were stolen and sold to Operation Zero.\n\nAnother unanswered question is: Did anyone, either the U.S. government or L3Harris, alert Apple, Google, or whichever tech company’s products were affected by the zero-day flaws, now that the exploits had leaked?\n\nAny company or developer would want to know that someone could have used (or could still use) a zero-day against their users and customers so that they can patch the flaws as soon as possible. And at this point, the zero-days are of no use for L3Harris and its government customers.\n\nWhen I asked Apple and Google, neither company responded to my inquiries. L3Harris did not respond either.\n\nThen there’s the mystery of the scapegoat, who was fired after Williams accused him of stealing and leaking code.\n\nAt sentencing, Justice Department prosecutorsconfirmedthat the employee was fired, saying Williams “stood idly by while another employee of the company was essentially blamed for [his] own conduct.” In response, Williams’ attorney rebuffed prosecutors, claiming that the former employee “was fired for misconduct,” citing claims of dual-employment and improper handling of the company’s intellectual property.\n\nAccording to a court document submitted by Williams’ lawyers, as part of the L3Harris internal investigation, the company placed the employee on leave, seized his devices, transferred them to the U.S., and “offered them to the FBI.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, an unnamed FBI spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add apart from the Justice Department’spress release.\n\nAfter being fired, that employee, whom we identified with the alias Jay Gibson, received a notification from Apple that his personal iPhone was targeted “with a mercenary spyware attack.”\n\nApplesendsthesenotificationsto users it thinks were the target of attacks using tools like those made by NSO Group or Intellexa.\n\nWho tried to hack Gibson? He received the notification on March 5, 2025, more than six months after the FBI investigation had begun. The FBI “regularly interacted with [Williams] in late 2024 through the summer of 2025,”according to a court document.\n\nGiven the nature of the leaked tools, it is plausible that the FBI, or perhaps even a U.S. intelligence agency, targeted Gibson as part of the investigation into Williams’ leaks. But we just don’t know, and there’s a chance that neither the public, nor Gibson, will ever find out.\n\nUpdated to clarify 22nd paragraph attributing the tools’ lack of classification to Williams’ lawyers.",

      "content": "Across the country, discontenthas explodedover the ever-growing glut of server farms that have accompanied the AI boom. Anger has grown so loud that it’s begun to shift legislative agendas. Some states and communities are mulling temporary bans on new data center development altogether. Earlier this month, New York joined the club, with a bold new proposal to halt the local cloud build-out in its tracks.\n\nA new billin New York State would impose a three-year moratorium on the issuance of new permits for data center construction throughout the state, while local regulators are given a chance to study the environmental and economic impacts the industry is having on communities. The bill’s co-authors, state senator Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Anna Kelles, have called the legislation the “strongest” introduced in the country.\n\nWhile no statewide moratoriums have passed so far, local bans are proliferating fast. Several weeks before Krueger and Kelles introduced their bill, the New Orleans City Councilpassed a moratorium, pausing all new data center construction in the city for one year. In early January, Madison, Wisconsin,passed a similar lawafter protests erupted over regional tech projects.\n\nSimilar policies have also passed in droves of communities throughout construction hot spots likeGeorgiaandMichigan, as well as in many other regions throughout the country.\n\nEnvironmental activistshave long taken aim at data centers, but the more recent concerns have come from high-level lawmakers, drawing on populist anger at the tech industry broadly. In conservative Florida, for instance, Gov. Ron DeSantis recently announced anAI “bill of rights”that gives local communities the right to limit new data center construction.\n\nIn liberal Vermont, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders hassuggested a nationwide moratorium. And in Arizona, where the political milieu isdecidedly mixed, Gov. Katie Hobbs recently said she supportedpulling the industry’s tax incentives. Politicians have even begun to fight over the topics, with the governor of Mississippitaking shotsat Sanders online over his moratorium proposal.\n\nThe political resistance is coming just as tech companies commit more and more money to building out infrastructure. The four biggest spenders — Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft — plan to spenda whopping $650 billionin capital expenditures over the next year, the vast majority of it going to data center build-outs. Even more spending isplanned in the following years, as the companies race to secure as much compute capacity as possible.\n\nBut the speed and scale of those projects has made them increasingly unpopular, according to recent polling.A recent Echelon Insights pollfound 46% of respondents would oppose plans to build a data center in their community, compared with 35% in support.A different pollfrom Politico found that, while there is considerable concern about the facilities, many voters don’t have much of an opinion either way — making it possible for public sentiment to be swayed in either direction.\n\nThe industry is already spending big to attempt to change those numbers — at least in the regions where it matters. In January, the Financial Timesreported thatsome of the industry’s biggest data center operators were planning a “lobbying blitz,” with plans to “boost spending on targeted advertising and engagement” aimed at the communities where they build.\n\nTech companies are also making real concessions, likethe planned Rate Payer Protection Pledgethat would make them responsible for supplying power to any new AI data centers. But it’s not clear those measures will be enough to bring the public around.\n\nDan Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition, argued, in a conversation with TechCrunch, that data centers should appeal to smaller communities because they provide revenue without straining those communities’ limited resources. If the incentives are cut off and companies decide not to build in those places, the revenue also won’t be there. “That’s where statewide policy considerations come in,” he said. “Are you going to limit communities in which these businesses could be a significant benefit for them?”\n\nIn general, data center moratoriums are meant to give communities breathing room while policymakers study the potential costs and benefits of allowing such facilities to be built in their communities. Therate of constructionin some states has accelerated at such a pace that communities are unsure of how the industry will impact them in the long run.\n\nJustin Flagg, director of communications and environmental policy for Sen. Krueger’s office, told TechCrunch that the legislation was driven, in part, by what he called the energy affordability crisis in New York. Said crisis has troubled both rate payers and politicians.\n\nA group of 30 state lawmakers recentlycalled uponthe state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, to declare an “energy state of emergency” in New York due to rate increases. While there area diversity of factorsat work in driving up energy prices, there’s aconsensusthat the growth in data centers is making the problem worse, not better.\n\n“There’s broad discontent being expressed about energy prices,” Flagg said. “We certainly hear that constantly from our constituents, whose electric and gas rates are going up.” He added that local pushback was also being driven by environmental concerns — which he described as the “water impact and the noise and the local infrastructure impact as well.”\n\nIn response to those grid concerns, major tech companies — includingMicrosoft, Google, Meta, andOpenAI— have promised topay for their additions to the electrical gridin the communities where they operate, often installing behind-the-meter power sources paired with the new data centers.\n\nThe Washington Postrecently reportedthat Silicon Valley is increasingly looking to build its own private electrical supply — a kind of “shadow grid” — that can be used to operate the power-consumptive properties that are now fueling the AI industry. The strategy involves standing up massive new private power sources instead of relying on the public grid.\n\nOne example of this practice comes from xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup, which — at the site of its massive data center in Memphis, Tennessee,known as “Colossus”— built a series of methane gas turbines that have been accused of polluting the local community.\n\nThe company’s efforts have already run into significant trouble. xAI hadreportedlytold local officials that, due to a legal loophole, the turbines were exempt from air-quality permits. In January, the Environmental Protection Agencyruled thatMusk’s company was not exempt from the permits, making their previous operation illegal. Environmental activists, decrying the facility’s discharge of “smog-forming pollution, soot, and hazardous chemicals,”announcedearlier this month that they planned to sue the company over it. Musk’s facility has since permitted its turbines.\n\nAs the xAI example illustrates, if the “shadow grid” strategy purports to solve one problem (public grid overload), it threatens to create a host of new ones — with environmental activists and local communities alikeexpressing concernfor how the new facilities could spew pollution into people’s backyards.\n\nAt the federal level, the Trump administration — which has made AI one of its top priorities — has also sought to characterize the industry as responsible stewards of the communities in which they build. Indeed, Trump officials havefloated a hypothetical policyto force AI companies to internalize the costs of their additions to local electrical grids, although the details on this policy remain vague.\n\nFor years, communities have incentivized data center development through tax breaks. Last summer,an analysis by CNBCfound that 42 states throughout the U.S. either have no sales tax or provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to tech firms. Of that number, some 16 states publicly reported how much they had awarded to companies through tax breaks. The forfeited revenue amounted to some $6 billion over a period of five years, the outlet wrote.\n\nNow, however, more and more states are thinking about turning off the spigot. In Georgia, for instance,a variety of bills were recently introducedthat would crack down on the industry’s benefits. State senator Matt Brass, who has introduced a bill thatwould nix the server sales tax exemption, told TechCrunch that he doesn’t think tech companies need the extra money, nor does he think dispensing with the benefit will dissuade them from doing business in the state. “In Georgia, if you compare us to other states, our property taxes are low, our property values are low, our overall tax burden is low,” Brass said. “So, you know, our overall business climate is good. That should be the attraction.”\n\nBrass, who chairs the state’s rules committee, told TechCrunch that he expects there to be significant support for his policy. A similar piece of legislation passed the Georgia legislature in 2024, but it was vetoed by the governor. Brass added that, were the exemption to be done away with, he believes it could generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the state.\n\nIn Ohio, a similar policy battle is currently playing out. A group of Democratic lawmakers recentlyintroduced legislationthat would — like in Georgia — move to nix the state’s sales tax exemption. A similar policy was introduced last year, but — like in Georgia — it was defeated by the state’s governor, Mike DeWine.\n\n“The most ridiculous tax break on the books currently is for data centers,” one of the bill’s supporting lawmakers, state Sen. Kent Smith,recently said. “That tax break needs to end, for the benefit of everyone who’s got an electric bill.”\n\nAt the same time, there are still plenty of lawmakers who support the server sales tax exemption. In Colorado, state representative Alex Valdezrecently introduced a billthat would enshrine data centers’ loophole for the next 20 years. Valdez told TechCrunch that the exemption is merely a carrot to get tech companies in the door. Once they set up a base of operations in the state, they become a source of passive revenue that inevitably boomerangs back to benefit the communities in which they operate, he said.",

Other companies that have graduated from X include robotaxi company Waymo and drone delivery company Wing.\n\nWendy Tan White has served as Intrinsic’s CEO since its spinout in 2021.\n\nThe company hit the ground running. A few months after announcing its independence,Intrinsic acquired Vicarious, a fellow robotics software company, in April 2022. While the purchase price wasn’t disclosed, Vicarious had raised about $250 million from VCs and tech bigwigs like Jeff Bezos.\n\nA few months later, Intrinsicacquired several for-profit divisionsof Open Robotics, a nonprofit organization that builds hardware and software platforms for the robotics industry.\n\nDespite this rapid expansion,Intrinsic laid off 20% of its workforcein January 2023.\n\nThe company announced its first product, Flowstate, just a few months later. Flowstate is a software platform fordeveloping robotics workflowsaimed at developers that don’t have deep robotics experience — aligning with the company’s mission to make robotics more accessible.\n\nSince then, the company has fine-tuned the technology, improved its simulation capabilities, and released its Intrinsic Vision AI model in late 2025.\n\nIntrinsic announced ajoint venture with electronics manufacturer Foxconnin October 2025 that entails the two companies working together on general-purpose intelligent robots to transform how electronics are manufactured, with the goal of full factory automation.\n\nNow, the company is working toward those goals with closer collaboration with Google’s AI prowess.\n\n“Combined with Google’s incredible AI and infrastructure, we’re going to unlock the promise of physical AI for a much broader set of manufacturing businesses and developers. This will fundamentally shift production, from its economics to operations, and enable truly advanced manufacturing,” Tan White wrote in the company’s blog post.\n\nThis move makes a lot of sense for Google, as many tech leaders, includingNvidia’s Jensen HuangandQualcomm’s Cristiano Amon, see physical AI as the next natural step in the monetization and advancement of AI models and technology.",

      "content": "Peter Steinberger, the creator of theviral AI agent OpenClawwho has sincebeen hired by OpenAI,has some advice for those experimenting with AI technology, including AI agents. From his own experience, the best way to build today is to explore, be playful, and not expect to be an expert at what you do right away.\n\n“I wish I could say that I had the unified plan in the beginning, but a lot of it was just exploration,” Steinberger said. “I wanted things, and those things didn’t exist, and … let’s say I prompted them into existence.”\n\nThe developer was chatting with OpenAI’s Head of Developer Experience, Romain Huet, on the first episode ofthe company’s new Builders Unscripted podcast. Here, he spoke about what OpenClaw was like in its early days and how he didn’t have a plan when he got started.\n\nSteinberger explained he began by building a tool that would integrate with WhatsApp, but then set it aside for a bit and focused on other things, as he assumed the AI labs would build something like what he was working on in the near future.\n\n“I just experimented a lot. My mission was, kind of like, to have fun and inspire people,” Steinberger noted. By last November, however, the developer was surprised that no AI labs had started to build what he wanted to use. That led him to create the initial prototype of what’s now OpenClaw.\n\n“Where it really clicked was where I was at this weekend trip in Marrakesh, and I found myself using it way more because it was so convenient … There was no really good internet. [But] WhatsApp just works everywhere,” he said. The tool made it easy for him to find restaurants, look up things on his computer, send texts to friends, and more.\n\nThe more he played with the technology, Steinberger realized how good modern AI models have become at problem-solving, much like coders are.\n\n“Now they can just, like, actually come up with the solutions themselves, even though you never programmed them at all,” he noted.\n\nThroughout the process of building, Steinberger said that his workflow improved — and he stresses to other developers that’s something that can take time, so don’t give up.\n\n“There’s these people that … write software in the old way, and the old way is going to go away,” he pointed out. They then decide to try vibe coding but are disappointed with the results.\n\n“I think vibe coding is a slur,” said Steinberger, basically suggesting that it’s not as simple a process at first as the term makes it sound. “They try AI, but they don’t understand that it’s a skill,” he said, then compared the process of coding with AI to learning guitar.\n\n“You’re not going to be good at guitar on the first day,” he said. Instead, he recommends that people approach learning with a more playful attitude. If he writes a prompt now, he has a gut feeling as to how long it will take, and if it takes longer, he reflects on what may have gone wrong and adapts.\n\n“My … advice always is, approach it in a playful way. Build something that you always wanted to build. If you’re at least a little bit of a builder, there has to be something on the back of your mind that you want to build. Like, just play.”\n\nThis ability to experiment and have fun is what’s most important, especially at a time when people are worried their jobs will be overtaken by AI.\n\n“If your identity is: I want to create things. I want to solve problems. If you’re high agency, if you’re smart, you will be in more demand than ever,” Steinberger said.",

      "content": "AI chatbots have become embedded in the lives of American teenagers, according toa reportpublished Tuesday by the Pew Research Center.\n\nWhile the most common uses of AI among this demographic include searching for information (57%) and getting help with schoolwork (54%), teens are also using AI to fill roles that would typically be occupied by friends or family. Sixteen percent of U.S. teens say they use AI for casual conversation, while 12% use AI chatbots for emotional support or advice.\n\nSome teens may find solace in talking to chatbots, but mental health professionals are wary. General-purpose tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok are not designed for such uses, and in the mostextreme cases, these chatbots can have life-threatening psychological effects.\n\n“We are social creatures, and there’s certainly a challenge that these systems can be isolating,” Dr. Nick Haber, a Stanford professor researching the therapeutic potential of LLMs,told TechCrunch recently. “There are a lot of instances where people can engage with these tools and then can become not grounded to the outside world of facts, and not grounded in connection to the interpersonal, which can lead to pretty isolating — if not worse — effects.”\n\nPew’s survey also shows a discrepancy between teenagers’ self-reported AI usage and the extent to which their parents think they engage with this technology. About 51% of parents said that their teen uses chatbots, while 64% of teens reported using them.\n\nThe majority of parents are okay with their teens using AI to search for information (79%) or get help with schoolwork (58%), but far fewer parents approve of their teens using AI chatbots for casual conversation (28%) or to get emotional support or advice (18%). In fact, 58% of parents are not okay with their child using AI for such purposes.\n\nAI safety is acontentioustopicamong leading tech companies, to say the least. But one popular chatbot maker, Character.AI, made the choice todisablethe chatbot experience for users under the age of 18. This decision followed public outcry and lawsuits filed overtwo teenagers’suicides, which took place after prolonged conversations with the company’s chatbots. OpenAI, meanwhile, made the decision to sunset its particularly sycophanticGPT-4o model, which sparked backlash from people who had come to rely on the model for emotional support.\n\nThough a majority of teens use AI chatbots in some way, they have mixed feelings about the impact of this kind of technology on society. When asked how they think AI will impact society over the next 20 years, 31% of teens said the impact would be positive, while 26% said it would be negative.",

      "content": "Chip giant and world’s most valuable company Nvidia reportedrecord profitsin its most recent quarter on Wednesday, as demand for AI compute continues to skyrocket.\n\n“The demand for tokens in the world has gone completely exponential,” CEO Jensen Huang said on a call with analysts following the results. “I think we’re all seeing that, to the point where even our six-year-old GPUs in the cloud are completely consumed and the pricing is going up.”\n\nThe company reported $68 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, up 73% from the prior year, with $62 billion of that revenue coming from the company’s data center business.\n\nNotably, Nvidia divided the data center revenue into $51 billion in compute revenue (largely GPUs) and $11 billion in networking products like NVLink. The company reported $215 billion in revenue for the full year.\n\nAs in previous quarters, the company did not report any revenue from chip exports to China, despite the recent lifting of export restrictions by the U.S. government. “While small amounts of H200 products for China-based customers were approved by the US government, they have yet to generate any revenue, and we do not know whether any imports will be allowed into China,” Colette Kress, the company’s chief financial officer, said.\n\n“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress,” she continued, in an apparent reference toMoore Threads’ IPO in December, “and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term.”\n\nDuring the investor call, Huang also addressed the company’s pending investment in OpenAI, which has beenreported at $30 billion.\n\n“We continue to work with OpenAI toward a partnership agreement. We believe we are close,” Huang said. He also referenced partnerships with Anthropic, Meta, and Elon Musk’s xAI. However,statements Nvidia filedwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday emphasized that there was “no assurance” an investment would take place.\n\nHuang also addressed concerns about the sustainability oftech companies’ capex commitments, saying he believed the compute investments would soon bring revenue.\n\n“In this new world of AI, computeisrevenue. Without compute, there’s no way to generate tokens. Without tokens, there’s no way to grow revenues,” Huang said. “We’ve reached the inflection point and we’re generating profitable tokens that are productive for customers and profitable for the cloud service providers”",

The social media giant says the awards show, called “The Snappys,” is designed to celebrate “the creators shaping culture on Snapchat.”\n\nCreators will receive awards like “Spotlight MVP,” “Best Storyteller,” and “Breakout Creator of the Year,” alongside awards across fashion, beauty, sports, music, food, and games. Additional categories include collaboration, comedy, and cultural impact.\n\n“Together, these honors reflect the many ways creators spark conversations, build community, and define culture on Snapchat,” the company wrote in ablog post. “The Snappys reinforces Snapchat’s ongoing commitment to celebrating creators not just as users, but as artists, entertainers, and cultural leaders.”\n\nSnapchat is the latest social media platform to launch awards for creators. Meta-owned Instagramintroduced a new “Ring” awardlast October to recognize creators around the world. Instagram announced the 25 winners online, and each winner received a physical custom ring designed by English fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner, along with a digital golden ring around their Instagram profile.\n\nIn November, TikTok launched its first-everTikTok Awards showin the U.S. Like Snapchat, Instagram handed out category-specific awards, like “Creator of the Year,” “Video of the Year,” “Muse of the Year,” “Breakthrough Artist of the Year,” and more. It’s worth noting that TikTok has also hosted awards shows in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, and Korea.\n\nSnapchat’s awards are more in line with TikTok’s, as it will also host a traditional awards show where the winners will be revealed live at the event. The company says the show will bring together “creators, industry leaders, and special guests.” One of the “special guests” is DJ Khaled, who will be receiving Snapchat’s “Lifetime Achievement Award.”\n\nBy launching awards, Snapchat and its rivals are positioning themselves as more than just social media apps and as notable players in the entertainment industry.\n\nThe Snappys will be hosted by comedian and creator Matt Friend and will take place at Snap‘s Santa Monica headquarters. Snapchat says it will release more details, including lists of nominees, in the coming weeks.",
