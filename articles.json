      "content": "An internal research study at Meta dubbed “Project MYST” created in partnership with theUniversity of Chicago, found that parental supervision and controls — such as time limits and restricted access — had little impact on kids’ compulsive use of social media. The study also found that kids who experienced stressful life events were more likely to lack the ability to moderate their social media use appropriately.\n\nThis was one of the notable claims revealed during testimony at the social media addiction trial that began last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is identified by her initials “KGM” or her first name, “Kaley.” She, along with her mother and others joining the case, is accusing social media companies of creating “addictive and dangerous” products that led the young users to suffer anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and more.\n\nThe case is now one of several landmark trials that will take place this year, which accuse social media companies of harming children. The results of these lawsuits will impact these companies’ approach to their younger users and could prompt regulators to take further action.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff sued Meta, YouTube, ByteDance (TikTok), and Snap, but the latter two companieshadsettledtheir claims before the trial’s start.\n\nIn the jury trial now underway in L.A., Kaley’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, brought up an internal study at Meta, which he said found evidence that Meta knew of, yet didn’t publicize, these specific harms.\n\nIn Project MYST, which stands for the Meta and Youth Social Emotional Trends survey, Meta’s research concluded that “parental and household factors have little association with teens’ reported levels of attentiveness to their social media use.”\n\nOr, in other words, even when parents try to control their children’s social media use, either by using parental controls or even just household rules and supervision, it doesn’t im",

Felser noticed it was a common occurrence among startups producing novel materials. Fesler, who previously founded and invested in software startups, said the problem they faced seemed a bit unfair.\n\n“Software companies sell at a negative margin all the time in the beginning, you know, Uber, Lyft, you can look at lots of different examples,” he said. “But for materials companies, they they’re not allowed to do that. One of the questions I had is, ‘why is that?’”\n\nFelser found that unlike software companies, which can quickly add more capacity from cloud service providers, materials startups face a market skeptical of their ability to scale up production without a guaranteed customer.\n\nFelser decided to give them one.\n\nFelser doesn’t run a company with a big budget for clever materials, but he knows a few. And as a climate tech investor, he knows more than a few startups that could benefit from a well-known customer.\n\nFelser has been quietly working on a new project, called Material Scale, that brings the two sides together using a hybrid debt-equity investment vehicle to give materials startups a boost, TechCrunch has learned. Material Scale will initially focus on climate tech startups in the apparel industry.\n\nMaterial Scale is betting on startups with commercial-ready products that are ready to scale if a customer can purchase in bulk. Buyers will commit enough funds to cover the cost of the material at market price. Material Scale will fund the difference through a combination of loans and warrants in the startup.\n\n“It’s really minimally dilutive,” Felser sa",

CEO Brashears, President Ramos, and VP of Product Grown-Haeberli realized the opportunity when designing a new generation of compute-hungry SpaceX satellites forced them to assess the optical transceiver market, and they saw its limitations.\n\nOptical transceivers are particularly important for data centers aimed at training and operating large deep learning models, because they allow multiple GPUs to work in concert. One established U.S. supplier, AOI,won a contractworth $4 billion to provide components for AWS data centers last year.\n\n“Someone will brag about a million GPU cluster; you have to multiply by four to five for the number of transceivers in that cluster,” Brashears explained.\n\nThe company’s goal is to manufacture a thousand units per day within the year so they can begin qualifying for bulk orders in 2027 and 2028.\n\nThe optical transceiver market is dominated by Chinese firms and suppliers, and Mesh sees an advantage in building its supply chain outside of that country. While trade restrictions haven’t impacted the market yet, the founders and their backers see themselves as getting in front of a national security dilemma.\n\n“If AI is the most important technology in several generations (which we believe to be true), to have critical parts of AI data center capex run through misaligned/competitive countries is a problem,” Thrive Partner Philip Clark wrote TechCrunch. “In the immediate term, Mesh is solving our need for better ways to do interconnect i",

Some of the firm’s other notable investments include Databricks, Anduril, and Cursor. The firm also incubates companies, having spun up 12 so far, with at least six now having reached unicorn status.\n\nThe firm’s strategy is to “commit deeply to a small number of founders,” the firm said in its announcement. “Concentration demands loyalty to the founders and missions we back.”\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Josh Kushner, founder of the firm, said he believed the winners of the AI boom would “be bigger than we can ever imagine,” and that the technology is still nascent.\n\nThrive’s massive raise also hints at something else. IPO rumors have swirled around OpenAI and SpaceX in particular, bringing considerable interest from limited partners awaiting returns.

As hyperscalers prepare to build out billions of dollars’ worth of new data centers, the price for DRAM chips has jumpedroughly 7x in the last year.\n\nAt the same time, there’s a growing discipline in orchestrating all that memory to make sure the right data gets to the right agent at the right time. The companies that master it will be able to make the same queries with fewer tokens, which can be the difference between folding and staying in business.\n\nSemiconductor analystDoug O’Laughlinhas an interesting look at the importance of memory chips on his Substack, where he talks with Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka. They’re both semiconductor guys, so the focus is more on the chips than the broader architecture; the implications for AI software are pretty significant too.\n\nI was particularly struck by this passage, in which Bercovici looks at the growing complexity ofAnthropic’s prompt-caching documentation:\n\nThe tell is if we go to Anthropic’s prompt caching pricing page. It started off as a very simple page six or seven months ago, especially as Claude Code was launching — just “use caching, it’s cheaper.” Now it’s an encyclopedia of advice on exactly how many cache writes to pre-buy. You’ve got 5-minute tiers, which are very common across the industry, or 1-hour tiers — and nothing above. That’s a really important tell. Then of course you’ve got all sorts of arbitrage opportunities around the pricing for cache reads based on how many cache writes you’ve pre-purchased.\n\nThe question here is how long Claude holds your prompt in cached memory: You can pay for a 5-minute window, or pay more for an hour-long window. It’s much cheaper to draw on data that’s still in the cache, so if you manage it right, you can save an awful lot. There is a catch though: Every new bit of data you add to the query may bump somethin",

InJune 2025, it had announcedMistral Compute, an AI cloud infrastructure offering which it now hopes Koyeb will accelerate.\n\nFounded in 2020 by three former employees of French cloud provider Scaleway, Koyeb aimed to help developers process datawithout worrying about server infrastructure— a concept known as serverless. This approach gained relevance as AI grew more demanding, also inspiring the recent launch ofKoyeb Sandboxes, which provide isolated environments to deploy AI agents.\n\nBefore the acquisition, Koyeb’s platform already helped users deploy models from Mistral and others. In ablog post, Koyeb said its platform will continue operating. But its team and technology will now also help Mistral deploy models directly on clients’ own hardware (on premises), optimize its use of GPUs, and help scale AI inference — the process of running a trained AI model to generate responses — according to a press release from Mistral.\n\nAs part of the deal, Koyeb’s 13 employees and its three co-founders, Yann Léger, Edouard Bonlieu, and Bastien Chatelard (pictured above in 2020), are set to join the engineering team of Mistral, overseen by CTO and co-founder Timothée Lacroix. Under his leadership, Koyeb expects its platform to transition into a “core component” of Mistral Compute over the coming months.\n\n“Koyeb’s product and expertise will accelerate our development on the Compute front, and contribute to building a true AI cloud,” Lacroix wrote in a statement.
