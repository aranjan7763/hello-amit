      "content": "Before heading on a trip to Tahoe last weekend, GM offered me the use of the company’s 9,000-pound monument to excess – the new 2026 electric Escalade IQL (starting at $130,405) – for a week to test-drive. Before you continue, note that I’m not a professional car reviewer. TechCrunch has excellent transportation writers; I am not one of them. I do, however, drive anelectric car.\n\nI was immediately game. I’d first glimpsed one last summer at a car show, where some regional car dealers had stationed themselves at the end of a long field dotted with exquisite vintage automobiles. My immediate reaction was “Jesus, that’s enormous,” followed by a surprising admiration for its design, which, despite its enormous scale, shows restraint. For lack of a better word, I’m going to say it’s “strapping.” Its proportions just work.\n\nMy excitement waned pretty quickly when the car was dropped off at my house a day before our departure time. This thing is a monstrosity — at 228.5 inches long and 94.1 inches wide, it made our own cars look like toys. My first apartment in San Francisco was smaller. Trying to drive it up my driveway was a little harrowing, too; it’s so big, and its hood is so high, that if you’re ascending a road at a certain slope – we live midway down a hill; our mailbox is at the top of it – you can’t see whatever is directly in front of the car.\n\nI thought about just leaving it in the driveway for the duration of the trip. The other alternative was doing what I could to grow more comfortable with the prospect of driving it 200 miles to Tahoe City, so I tooled around in it that night and the next day, picking up dinner, heading to an exercise class — just basic stuff around town. When I ran into a friend on the street, I volunteered as quickly as possible that this was not my new car, that I was going to possibly review it, and wasn’t its size ridiculous? It felt like a tank. I thought: other than hotels that use SUVs like the Escalade to ferry guests around, what kind of monster chooses a car like this?\n\nFive days later, it turns out that I am that kind of monster.\n\nLook, I don’t know how or when I fell for this car. If I’d written this review after two days, it would read very differently. Even now, I’m not so blind that I don’t see its shortcomings.\n\nIt was the Escalade’s performance in a terrible snowstorm that really won my heart, but let me walk you through the steps between “Ugh, this car is a tank” and “Yes! This car is atank.”\n\nJust getting into it requires a little more exertion than would seem to make sense. I’m fairly athletic and I still found myself wondering if this thing shouldn’t come with an automated step stool.\n\nInside is where digital maximalism does its work. The dashboard opens with a 55-inch curved LED screen with 8K resolution that reads less like a car display and more like a situation room. Front passengers get their own screens. Second-row passengers also get 12.6-inch personal screens along with stowable tray tables, dual wireless chargers, and — with the most lavish version of the car — massage seats that will make them forget they’re in a vehicle at all. Google Maps handles navigation. And the polarized screen technology deserves its own praise: while one of my kids binge-watched Hulu in the front seat, not a frame of it leaked into my sightline from behind the wheel.\n\nThe cabin itself is built around the premise that no one inside should feel crowded, and it delivers. Front legroom stretches to 45.2 inches; the second row offers 41.3; even the third row manages 32.3 inches. Seven adults could share this machine for a long while without fraying each other’s nerves. Heated and ventilated leather seats with 14-way power adjustment come standard in the first two rows, and the whole operation runs on 5G Wi-Fi.\n\nThe car also comes standard with Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free driving system, which I’m not sure I quite figured out. True car reviewers seem to love it; when I tried it, the car felt like it was drifting to an alarming degree between the outer boundaries of the highway lane, and when that happens, it unleashes an escalating sequence of warnings. First, a red steering wheel icon materializes on-screen. Then your seat pulses haptic warnings against your rump. Ignore those and a chime — both reminder and reproach — fills the cabin. GM calls this impolite series a “driver takeover request.”\n\nDid I mention the 38-speaker AKG Studio sound system? So good.\n\nAs for the exterior — this is a handsome giant, but it takes some getting used to. At first, I found the grille, which is just for show, almost comically imposing. This is definitely a car for people who are the boss, or want to be the boss, or want to look like the boss while privately dealing with existential crises. Pulling up to a glass-lined restaurant one night, I’m pretty sure I blinded half the patrons as I swung into a parking spot perpendicular to the building, the Escalade’s headlights flooding through the windows.\n\nThen there is the light show the car launches whenever it detects you approaching via the key or the MyCadillac app. It’s as if it’s saying, “Hey, chief, where we headed?” before you’ve so much as touched a door handle. (In the vernacular of Cadillac, this is thanks to its “advanced, all-LED exterior lighting system,” highlighted by a “crystal shield” illuminated grille and crest, along with vertical LED headlamps and “choreography-capable tail lamps.”)\n\nIt is, objectively, a bit much. I loved it immediately.\n\nDespite its size, the Escalade IQL is unexpectedly nimble. Not “sports car darting through traffic” nimble, but “I can’t quite believe something this colossal doesn’t handle like a battleship” nimble.\n\nNow we arrive at the frustrations. The front trunk — or “frunk” in the lexicon of EV devotees — operates in mysterious and frustrating ways. Opening requires holding the button until completion. Release prematurely and it halts mid-ascent, frozen in automotive purgatory, forcing you to restart the entire sequence. Closing demands the same sustained pressure. The rear trunk, conversely, requires two distinct taps followed by immediate button abandonment. Hold too long and nothing happens.\n\nRelatedly, twice, the vehicle refused to power down after I’d finished driving. The car simply sat there, running, even when shifted to park and opened the door (which tells the car to turn off). One clunky solution: open the frunk, close the frunk, shift into drive, then park, then exit entirely.\n\nAs for the software, it’s absolutely fine unless you’ve owned a Tesla, in which case, prepare for disappointment. This seems to be true across the board — everyone I know who owns both a Tesla and another EV, no matter how high end, says the same thing. Once you’ve internalized how effortlessly Tesla’s software dissolves barriers between intention and execution, every other automaker’s software feels like a compromise.\n\nWhich brings us to the nadir of the trip: charging in Tahoe during winter. For all its virtues, the Escalade IQL is, by any measure, a thirsty machine. The battery is a 205 kWh pack — enormous, and it needs to be, because the car burns through roughly 45 kWh per 100 miles, which is considerably more than comparable electric SUVs. Cadillac estimates 460 miles of range on a full charge, and in ideal conditions that holds up. Tahoe in winter, however, is not ideal conditions. We’d also arrived with less charge than we should have. A series of side trips on the way up, including an emergency detour to find shirts for a family member who had packed none, had eaten into the battery more than expected. By the time we needed to charge, we genuinely needed to charge.\n\nWe approached a Tesla Supercharger in Tahoe City that appeared on the MyCadillac app, but when we plugged in to the designated stall, nothing happened. We searched for answers, discovering that even Tesla stations that accept non-Tesla vehicles throttle energy to 6 kilowatts per hour anyway, but it was a frustrating experience. A nearby EVGo had shuttered a month prior. ChargePoint’s two units at the Tahoe City Public Utility lot were, respectively, broken and willing to connect but not to actually charge anything. We briefly contemplated a 35-mile drive to Incline Village, did the math on what stranded would actually look like, and decided against it. Then I discovered an Electrify America station 12 miles away. We drove through gathering snow, arrived shortly before 11 p.m., and it worked. We sat there for an hour fighting exhaustion before driving home.\n\nThe following morning revealed another issue via an app alert: tire pressure had dropped to 53 and 56 PSI in the front (recommended: 61) and 62 PSI in the rear (recommended: 68). I have no idea whether the car had been delivered that way or whether something else was going on — either way, it meant someone standing at a gas station filling tires while being pelted directly in the face with ice. (That someone was my husband.) For a family trip, it was going great.\n\nAt this point, in fact, I would have told you that the Escalade IQL is unquestionably luxurious and ideal for families of four or more who value space and technology. I would tell you it came burdened by real tradeoffs: forward visibility obstructed by its commanding hood, parking challenges inherent to its dimensions, limited charging infrastructure for a machine this ravenous, and tires tasked with supporting 9,000 pounds. It’s a beautiful car, I would have said, but it’s not for me.\n\nBut the snow that had started to fall kept falling. Within two days, eight feet had accumulated, making it impossible to ski — the entire point of the trip — and terrifying to drive. Except I found that I wasn’t terrified because we had the Escalade, which, because of its weight, felt like driving a tank through the snow. (The tires held steady after we’d inflated them., even as the week kept doing its worst.) What could have been harrowing felt serene. It was quiet, it was strong, it was taking charge in a bad situation.\n\nI also adjusted to the size. By the end of this past week I had stopped mouthing “I’m sorry” to whoever who was waiting for me to figure out where to park it. I had stopped caring what it said about me that I was driving a car whose entire design philosophy is: the owner of this vehicle is not waiting in line. Eight feet of snow had fallen, we needed groceries, and I was the one with the tank, suckers! I could sense my husband falling for the car, too.\n\nThen, as tends to happen in Tahoe, the snow stopped all at once and the sun came out, and the Escalade was just a very dirty car sitting in the driveway (sorry, GM!). It was in this moment that I realized: I still like it, and it’s not because of the emergency alone. I love riding high, with the speaker system flooding the car with a favorite soundtrack. That light show still gets me. The car’s long, curved LED screen is a marvel, among other features.\n\nThe frunk is still unhinged. I won’t soon forget the panic of not being able to charge the car where I thought I could. Parking this thing is truly an exercise in patience. I have strong opinions about unnecessary consumption. None of that has changed.\n\nI just also, somehow, want this car, so when the GM middleman comes to collect it, I may hide it under a tarp — a very large tarp — and tell him he has the wrong address.",

      "content": "While Elon Musk’s Neuralink likes to say it’s “pioneering” brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), China’s BCI industry is already quietly moving from research to scale.\n\nA new wave of startups is racing to commercialize both implantable and noninvasive BCIs, backed by stronger policy support, expanding clinical trials, and growing investor interest. So says Phoenix Peng, who has founded not one but two BCI startups. He’s a co-founder of NeuroXess, maker of BCI implants, as well as founder and CEO of noninvasive ultrasound BCI startup Gestala.\n\nHis belief in the potential of this market is founded on concrete action: Provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Zhejiang have alreadyset medical service pricingfor BCI, speeding its inclusion in the national medical insurance system.\n\nOver time, he foresees the technology extending beyond medicine “treating disease” to “human augmentation,” he said.\n\n“I have always maintained that neuroscience and AI are two sides of the same coin,” Peng said. “They are destined for deep integration, realizing direct high-bandwidth connections between the human brain and AI. BCI will serve as the ultimate bridge between carbon-based and silicon-based intelligence. While this may sound distant, it represents an unimaginably vast market in the future.”\n\nBut over the next three to five years, BCI use is likely to stay concentrated in healthcare, with the market reaching multibillion-dollar scale as insurance coverage expands, Peng told TechCrunch.\n\nIn August 2025, China’s industry ministry and six other agenciesreleased a national roadmapto further speed development of BCIs. The plan targets major technical milestones by 2027, common industry standards, and a full supply chain by 2030, with the goal of building globally competitive BCI companies and supporting smaller specialized firms.\n\nAsked what’s driving China’s rapid progress in BCI, Peng told TechCrunch it comes down to four factors. The first one is strong policy support, with cross-department collaboration that aligns technical standards and medical reimbursement. In December, at the 2025 Shenzhen BCI & Human-Computer Interaction Expo, Chinaannouncedan 11.6 billion yuan ($165 million) brain science fund to support BCI companies from research through commercialization.\n\nThe second factor is vast clinical resources, including large patient pools and lower research costs that accelerate trials. China’s national health insurance means quicker commercialization once the state approves a device. This compares to the U.S. where even after the FDA approves a device, private insurers, as the main payers, must each individually do so.\n\nResearchers have completed the country’s first fully implanted, wireless BCI trial — only the second globally — allowing a paralyzed patient to control devices without external hardware,per CGTN. Neuralink is the startup thatcompletedthefirst such trial.\n\n“In traditional electrical BCIs, Chinese firms have achieved clinical progress in motor and language decoding, spinal cord reconstruction, and stroke rehabilitation, with over 50 flexible implantable BCI clinical trials completed by mid-2025,” Peng said, adding that next-generation efforts are now moving toward whole-brain neural decoding and encoding, including ultrasound-based approaches such asGestala’s.\n\nThe third factor is China’s mature industrial manufacturing, Peng points out, spanning semiconductors, AI, and medical hardware, which supports fast R&D and prototyping. Finally, there is strategic investment in the market, with both state-led funds and private capital surging under national initiatives.\n\nSome recent key deals include Shanghai-based BCI startupStairMedTechnology raising $48 million (350 million yuan) in Series B funding in February 2025. BrainCo, a neurotech company developing its noninvasive BCIs and bionic limbs,has also quietlyfiled for a Hong Kong IPO, according to reports, after raising$287 million (2 billion yuan)earlier this year. Peng’s company, Gestala, which launched in January, is in talks with investors to close an angel round soon, he tells us.\n\nAll told, China’s BCI startups are ramping up to challenge U.S. leaders like Neuralink, Synchron, and Paradromics. Amongthe most active playersin China are NeuroXess, Neuracle, NeuralMatrix, BrainCo, Bo Rui Kang Tech, Aoyi Tech, Brainland Tech, and Zhiran Medical. They span approaches from implantable flexible interfaces to noninvasive brain-computer technologies.\n\nThis means that China’s BCI market was expected to grow to more than $530 million (3.8 billion yuan) in 2025, up from 3.2 billion yuan in 2024,according to media reports,with projectionsputting the market at over 120 billion yuan by 2040.\n\nBCIs are taking two paths. The first is invasive electrophysiological BCIs like NeuroXess and Neuralink that implant electrodes in people’s brains for precise neuron-level signals. But this type comes with surgery risks. The second type is noninvasive systems likeNeuroSkyandBrainCothat trade some precision for safety and ease of use. (These devices — typically headsets or headbands using electroencephalography (EEG) — read electrical activity through the skull.)\n\nThe field is now broadening further, with emerging approaches — including ultrasound, magnetoencephalography imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, optical methods, and hybrid BCIs — giving researchers new tools to read and influence brain activity.\n\nStartup founders also hope that noninvasive technology could help overcome adoption barriers. Not everyone is willing to undergo brain surgery to have a device implanted in their heads.\n\nUltrasound BCIs from companies likeOpenAI-backed Merge Labsand Gestala are targeting high-prevalence conditions such as chronic pain, stroke, and depression. As noninvasive solutions, these technologies are more readily accepted by patients and offer significantly greater commercial scalability.\n\nGestala, for instance, expects to roll out its first-generation product by Q3, said Peng. Early clinical trials have shown promising results, he added, saying that a single session reduced pain scores by 50%, with effects lasting one to two weeks.\n\nHongShan Capital, formerly Sequoia China, has meanwhile invested in Zhiran Medical, a startup founded in 2022 focused on improving long-term implant performance. The company uses flexible, high-throughput electrodes to reduce inflammation and signal loss associated with rigid implants.\n\n“Some technologies may look cutting-edge but far from practical application,” Yang Yunxia, a partner at HongShan Capital,wrote in a blog post. While others appear commercially viable, they face “high costs” or significant technical barriers, Yunxia contended. Ultimately, investment decisions come down to whether the investor believes a product can be developed into a sustainable business, the partner noted.\n\nOver the next five years, industry insiders expect China’s BCI regulations to align more closely with international standards, with a particular focus on regulatory approval and data sovereignty. Global frameworks developed by organizations such as theIECandISO, along with guidance from theU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are expected to serve as key reference points.\n\nChinese regulators are also expected to tighten oversight of invasive devices, as well as the data that all BCI devices generate, while easing approval for noninvasive technologies.\n\nAs for the ethicsthat confront brain-implanted or manipulating devices, China plans to strengthen informed-consent requirements, broaden ethics review beyond medicine, and move toward unified technical standards for clinical evaluation.",

How much is she being paid, and for what???”\n\nTrump’s post also includes a screenshot of a post from far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Rice’s comments and claiming, “The Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would result in a streaming monopoly, which the Obamas will have a significant stake in” due tothe deal between Netflix and the Obamas’ production company Higher Ground.\n\nWhile Trump’s post does not mention specific consequences,Netflix’s massive Warner Bros. acquisitionwill need to be approved by federal regulators.

Data centers have also been connected torising electricity prices.\n\nCiting a previous conversation with Bill Gates, the interviewer asked whether it’s accurate to say a single ChatGPT query currently uses the equivalent of 1.5 iPhone battery charges, to which Altman replied, “There’s no way it’s anything close to that much.”\n\nAltman also complained that many discussions about ChatGPT’s energy usage are “unfair,” especially when they focus on “how much energy it takes to train an AI model, relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query.”\n\n“But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human,” Altman said. “It takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart. And not only that, it took the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to figure out science and whatever, to produce you.”\n\nSo in his view, the fair comparison is, “If you ask ChatGPT a question, how much energy does it take once its model is trained to answer that question versus a human? And probably, AI has already caught up on an energy efficiency basis, measured that way.”\n\nYou can watch the full interview below.

But as the dust starts to settle, two once-hot business models are looking more like cautionary tales: LLM wrappers and AI aggregators.\n\nDarren Mowry, who leads Google’s global startup organization across Cloud, DeepMind, and Alphabet, says startups with these hooks have their “check engine light” on.\n\nLLM wrappers are essentially startups that wrap existing large language models, like Claude, GPT, or Gemini, with a product or UX layer to solve a specific problem. An example would be a startup thatuses AI to help students study.\n\n“If you’re really just counting on the back-end model to do all the work and you’re almost white-labeling that model, the industry doesn’t have a lot of patience for that anymore,” Mowry said on thisweek’s episode of Equity.\n\nWrapping “very thin intellectual property around Gemini or GPT-5” signals you’re not differentiating yourself, Mowry says.\n\n“You’ve got to have deep, wide moats that are either horizontally differentiated or something really specific to a vertical market” for a startup to “progress and grow,” he said. Examples of the deep-moat LLM wrapper type include Cursor, a GPT-powered coding assistant, or Harvey AI, a legal AI assistant.\n\nIn other words, startups can no longer expect to slap a UI on top of a GPT and get traction on their product like they could, perhaps, in mid-2024 when OpenAIlaunched its ChatGPT store. The challenge now is to build sustainable product value.\n\nAI aggregators are a subset of wrappers — they’re startups that aggregate multiple LLMs into one interface or API layer to route queries across models and give users access to multiple models. These companies typically provide an orchestration layer that includes monitoring, governance, or eval tooling. Think: AI search startup Perplexity or developer platform OpenRouter, which provides access to multiple AI models via a single API.\n\nWhile many of these platforms have gained ground, Mowry’s message is clear to incoming startups: “Stay out of the aggregator business.”\n\nGenerally speaking, aggregators aren’t seeing much growth or progression these days because, he says, users want “some intellectual property built in” to ensure they’re routed to the right model at the right time based on their needs — not because of behind-the-scenes compute or access constraints.\n\nMowry has been in the cloud game for decades, cutting his teeth at AWS and Microsoft before setting up shop at Google Cloud, and he’s seen how this plays out. He said the situation today mirrors the early days of cloud computing in the late 2000s/early 2010s as Amazon’s cloud business started taking off.\n\nAt that time, a crop of startups sprang up to resell AWS infrastructure, marketing themselves as easier entry points that provided tooling, billing consolidation, and support. But when Amazon built its own enterprise tools and customers learned to manage cloud services directly, most of those startups were squeezed out. The only survivors were the ones that added real services, like security, migration, or DevOps consulting.\n\nAI aggregators today face similar margin pressure as model providers expand into enterprise features themselves, potentially sidelining middlemen.\n\nFor his part, Mowry is bullish on vibe coding and developer platforms, which had a record-breaking year in 2025 with startups like Replit, Lovable, and Cursor (all Google Cloud customers, per Mowry) attracting major investment and customer traction.\n\nMowry also expects strong growth in direct-to-consumer tech, in companies that put some of these powerful AI tools into the hands of customers. He pointed to the opportunity for film and TV students to use Google’s AI video generator Veo to bring stories to life.\n\nBeyond AI, Mowry also thinks biotech and climate tech are having a moment — both in terms of venture investment going into the two industries and the “incredible amounts of data” startups can access to create real value “in ways we would never have been able to before.”",

      "content": "Wikipedia editors have decided to remove all links to Archive.today, a web archiving service that they said has been linked to more than 695,000 times across the online encyclopedia.\n\nArchive.today — which also operates under several other domain names, includingarchive.isandarchive.ph— is perhaps most widely used to access content that’s otherwise inaccessible behind paywalls. That also makes it useful as a source for Wikipedia citations.\n\nHowever, according tothe Wikipedia discussion page about this topic, “There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist […] and to forthwith remove all links to it.” (Ars Technicafirst reported on the decision.)\n\nThe discussion page says that Archive.today was previously blacklisted in 2013, only to be removed from the blacklist in 2016.\n\nWhy reverse course again? Because, the discussion page says, “Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack.” Plus, “evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”\n\nThe distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in question was allegedly directed at blogger Jani Patokallio. Patokallio wrote that beginning on January 11, users who loaded the archive’s CAPTCHA page have beenunknowingly loading and executing JavaScriptthat sends a search request to his Gyrovague blog, in an apparent attempt to get Patokallio’s attention and increase his hosting bill.\n\nBack in 2023, Patokallio publisheda blog postexamining Archive.today, whose ownership he described as “an opaque mystery.” And while he wasn’t able to track down a specific owner, he concluded the site was likely “a one-person labor of love, operated by a Russian of considerable talent and access to Europe.”\n\nMore recently, Patokallio said the webmaster at Archive.today asked him to take the post down for two or three months.\n\n“I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience,” the webmaster said, according toemails shared by Patokallio.\n\nPatokallio said that after he declined to take the post down, the webmaster responded with “an increasingly unhinged series of threats.”\n\nWikipedia editors alsopointed to webpage snapshotsin Archive.today that appeared to have been altered to insert Patokallio’s name — hence the concern that it’s become “unreliable” as an archive.\n\nWikipedia’sguidancenow calls for editors to remove links to Archive.today and related sites, replacing them with links to the original source or to other archives like the Wayback Machine.\n\nOna bloglinked from the Archive.today website, the site’s apparent ownerwrotethat Archive.today’s value to Wikipedia was “not about paywalls” but rather “the ability to offload copyright issues.” They laterwrotethat things had turned out “pretty well” and said they would “scale down the ‘DDoS’.”\n\n“Why didn’t you write about such events earlier, folks of the tabloids?” they said. “I don’t expect you to write anything good, because then who would read you, but there was plenty of dramas, wasn’t there? Because there was no Jani to nudge you?”",

      "content": "Scott Rogowsky is a comedian — he knows how to make fun of himself. That’s how he ended uproamingNew York City Comic Con with his own photo printed out like a “Wanted” poster, filming himself asking strangers, “Have you seen this man?”\n\nThese passersby showed a flicker of recognition, looking at the tall, bearded man like someone they had known in a past life, but couldn’t quite place.\n\n“You look familiar! Where do I know you from?” someone asks, as though Rogowsky could be a friend of a friend they had met at a party.\n\n“I know your face,” another person says, staring thoughtfully at the 41-year-old.\n\nA cosplayer dressed as a Ghostbuster finally figures it out.\n\n“Did you used to do that game show online?” he asks. “Like, every night?”\n\nRogowsky was just poking fun at himself, embracing the persona of a washed-up internet sensation. “I know my place,” he tells TechCrunch. “I’m not walking around like everybody’s supposed to know who I am.”\n\nBut seven years ago, everyone did.\n\nRogowsky was once the face of HQ Trivia, an app that exploded into popular culture, then faded out of the public consciousness almost as fast. Between 2017 and 2019, Rogowsky hosted the live mobile game show twice a day. At its peak, it drew more than 2.4 million daily viewers each night. It garnered 20 million lifetime downloads.\n\nNow the comedian is back with an app of his own called Savvy, which shares a lot of the DNA of HQ. Savvy’s first game,TextSavvy,is a daily live game show where players can earn cash — only this time, viewers are competing against Rogowsky in a word puzzle game that’s something like a hybrid of The New York Times’ Wordle and Connections, rather than trivia.\n\n“I believe this is my calling in a weird way,” Rogowsky says. “I get up there in front of that camera, there’s thousands of people watching at home — millions, back in the HQ days — and it just flows.”\n\nHQ Trivia was founded by the creators of Vine — the short-video platform that predated TikTok — and became a genuine cultural sensation.National newschannelsran storiesabout office workers dropping everything in the middle of the day to play HQ at 3 p.m. It wasgroundbreaking— appointment entertainment in a new format for the streaming era — until the company imploded in a barrage of unfortunate circumstances.\n\nOne founder, Colin Kroll, died of a drug overdose; the other founder, Rus Yusupov, was a divisive leader who clashed with his staff. He oncethreatened a journalistthat he would fire Rogowsky if she published an interview with Rogowsky where he mentioned liking Sweetgreen salads (Yusupov apparently didn’t want to give the fast-food chain free publicity). Most of all, HQ Trivia fell victim to the same trap that dooms so many startups. The company had raised a$15 million funding roundat a $100 million valuation, but it was — quite literally — giving away money, and it never developed a meaningful plan to monetize or build a sustainable business model. The company ultimately filed for bankruptcy in February 2020, with its demise later becoming fodder fordramatic documentariesandtrue-crime-adjacent podcastsdissecting how such a promising app failed so spectacularly.\n\nThis was, understandably, a real blow for Rogowsky. But more bad luck followed. A baseball superfan, Rogowsky had left HQ Trivia in 2019 for a job hostinga daily MLB Network show. He felt like he finally made it — he still lights up recalling running into Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez in the bathroom. But his show was canceled when the pandemic shut down baseball. He tried a handful of times over the years to recreate a company like HQ, but it was a journey of false starts.\n\n“Crazy s–t happened that I had no control over, and I felt like I was being tossed and turned on this raft in the ocean, just getting battered by things I can’t control, and that was sort of my attitude about life in general,” he says.\n\nHe considered himself retired from show business and opened a vintage store in California. But he missed comedy.\n\n“I went through this very meaningful personal transformation in the last couple of years,” he said. That process culminated in a seven-day mountain retreat called “the Hoffman Process,” a program that he describes as a digital detox combining lessons in psychology and neuroscience that helped him “take control of [his] life again.”\n\n“It gave me a lot of clarity to say, you know what, I have more to do here,” Rogowsky says. “I got out of that retreat and I was like, ‘I have something to say. People find me funny and entertaining. I find myself funny and entertaining.’”\n\nPeople tuned into HQ Trivia for the prospect of winning a cash prize, but the odds of winning were slim. Millions of viewers came back each night because of Rogowsky’s quick wit and charm, which earned him a cult following of fans who still call him “Quiz Daddy.”\n\n“From the psychological, emotional side, I couldn’t really process what was going on,” Rogowsky says, reflecting on his viral fame. “And in the seven humbling years since, I have a vastly new perspective… I have my fanbase, I have my core followers right here. They’re on board with me, and it’s a matter of getting the word out.”\n\nRogowsky received a lot of messages over the years from people who wanted to help him build the next HQ. But last year, a direct message on X from European game designer Johan de Jager grabbed his attention.\n\n“The idea was the host plays against the audience, so it’s like a two-way interaction,” Rogowsky says. “Imagine HQ if I wasn’t just asking the questions but also answering [them]… That adds another layer to it that no one had thought of before.”\n\nBut in the age of AI, where players can easily look up answers, Rogowsky was skeptical that a trivia game could work fairly, so Savvy embraced word puzzles instead.\n\nThe most that Savvy has paid out in a single game is around $400 — small compared to HQ’s occasional six-figure prize pools. That’s because Rogowsky and his co-founders are funding the company themselves.\n\n“Look, I know this isn’t the thousands of dollars that you saw on HQ, the hundreds of thousands that we eventually got to,” Rogowsky said on one recentTextSavvy broadcast. “But the difference is HQ was funded by venture capital. They had $8 million in the bank to start. They got another $15 million from other venture capitalists. We don’t got that… This is a low-budge operashe because I’m paying for it!”\n\nRogowsky says he has spoken with investors about Savvy and even gotten some enticing offers. But venture backing often comes with pressure on founders to maximize returns as fast as they can, a model that can set a business up to fail, as HQ demonstrated.\n\n“People want to 10x and 100x [their investment]… I’d be very happy to get to a point of profitability, to where we can just keep growing the company, keep hiring more people, keep making more games,” Rogowsky says. “I’m not looking for some type of eight-figure, nine-figure exit. This is what I want to do. I’m going to do this as long as I continue to wake up every morning and say, ‘Goddamn, I’m excited to get up there in front of that camera and have fun.’”\n\nTextSavvy is currently running a “Season 0,” a soft launch that allows the team to work through technical kinks before formally launching on March 1. So far, without much promotion, TextSavvy has peaked at about 4,000 viewers in one night.\n\nThat’s not much compared to the HQ days. Then again, when TechCrunch firstwrote about HQ, the app only had about 3,300 concurrent viewers. Who’s to say Savvy can’t do it again?\n\n“We’re not going anywhere this time,” Rogowsky said. “There’s no one to fire me. There’s no drama, there’s no tension. There’s not going to be a documentary about Savvy the way there was about HQ.”",

      "content": "Quantum computing will not be replacing supercomputers in 2026, let alone reaching industrial scale. And yet, investor appetite for companies pursuing the elusivequantum advantagehasn’t dwindled — it has increased.\n\nQuantonation Ventures, a venture firm investing in quantum and physics-based startups, hasclosed its oversubscribed second fund at €220 million, or approximately $260 million. That’s more than twice the size of its inaugural fund, and comes in addition to other signals that the quantum winter isn’t coming yet.\n\nWhile some warned that too much quantum hype and not enough tangible outcomes would eventually cause funding to collapse, the opposite has happened. Take the prediction that quantum will eventually crack modern encryption: that moment has no clear timeline, and yet governments have joined Big Tech in the race.\n\nIn the years since Quantonation’s launch in 2018, the quantum technology sector has become less incipient, with both technological breakthroughs and early demand from academic and industrial labs. As a result, there has also been “a shift in the types of investment opportunities that are available” to its second fund, Quantonation partner Will Zeng told TechCrunch.\n\nOne example is what Zeng describes as the “picks and shovels” opportunity, with companies developing technologies that support the quantum industry. He cited the example of Dutch startup Qblox, a long-boostrapped company that was selling quantum control hardware and software to Quantonation portfolio companies before the VC firmco-led its Series A.\n\nThis growing ecosystem also explains why backers are doubling down on Quantonation, and why other dedicated quantum funds such asQDNLand55 Northhave emerged.\n\n“VCs recognize that this is not an easy area to invest in at the early stage. The technology is very specific and complex, the markets are often new, and the teams as well,” Zeng said.\n\nThe firm’s thesis is to invest early to capture more value; but a handful of quantum companies have already gone public, and their shares have surged in recent months. According to Bloomberg, this “quantum frenzy” is partlystockedby Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huangdeclaredin June 2025 that “quantum computing is reaching an inflection point.”\n\nDespite the fact that quantum chips have yet to outperform classical computers outside of purpose-built benchmarks, consensus is growing that real-life applications are only a few years away, from life sciences to new materials. That’s in part thanks to advancements in error correction — the ability to fix the mistakes that quantum systems are prone to.\n\nGoogle’s Willow chipwas a landmark for error correction in 2024, but no architecture has won yet, and smaller players arestill in the race. Zeng noted that a surprising number of companies have enteredDARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. He also believes that beyond the public market excitement, “there are more exciting technologies that are currently private.”\n\nFor Quantonation, those private opportunities span a wider canvas than quantum chips alone. Fund two has already invested in 12 startups, with a target portfolio of around 25, covering not just the software and industrial layers needed to make quantum advantage real, but also adjacent physics-based technologies such as photonics and lasers.\n\nThis expanded thesis is backed by investors old and new. According to the firm, major investors from its first vintage, including Singapore’s Vertex Holdings and Bpifrance’s Fonds National d’Amorçage 2, have returned for the second fund, with new limited partners including the European Investment Fund, Grupo ACS, Novo Holdings, Planet First Partners, and Toshiba.\n\nQuantonation’s geographic scope is equally international. With dual headquarters in Paris and New York City, the firm has backed French quantum companies including Pasqal and Quandela, but also placed bets in Asia and North America — and will continue doing so.\n\n“In a lot of the areas we invest in, there’s not yet a clear regional winner, […] and a lot of the research has come from universities in many places,” Zeng said.",

To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free — just clickTechCrunch Mobility!\n\nEarlier this month,Waymochief safety officerMauricio Peñatestifiedbefore the Senate Commerce Committee as part of a hearing to talk about autonomous vehicles.\n\nMuch of the questioning fell under the standard “let’s educate the public” category. But it wasSen. Ed Markey’squestions about overseas workers, and Peña’s response, that everyone paid attention to.\n\nPeña, when asked about human workers who assist with Waymo vehicles’ navigation or emergencies, revealed that the company has remote guidance workers based overseas in the Philippines. This sparked some quick ire from Markey, who admonished Peña on how the company could rely on people without U.S. driver’s licenses to assist its vehicles on U.S. roads, among other criticisms.\n\nWaymo formulated a responsein a blog postwritten by Waymo’s head of global operations Ryan McNamara, which was published Tuesday. It has alsoshared the letterit sent to Markey’s office.\n\nThe post and letter do provide fresh insight about its remote-assistance operations. For instance, Waymo stresses it does not employ people who “remotely drive” the robotaxis. Instead, the self-driving systems are the ones in charge.\n\nRemote assistance (RA) workers are there to respond to specific requests for information that the Waymo self-driving system asks for. The company also has Event Response Teams, or ERTs, people who are certified for more complex tasks and are exclusively based in the United States. This team responds to collisions, interfacing with law enforcement and the rider, collecting data for regulatory reporting, and coordinating towing, Waymo says.\n\nWe also now know that Waymo has about “70 Remote Assistance agents on duty worldwide at any given time.” These folks are based in Arizona, Michigan, and in two cities in the Philippines, a detail that, again, has raised the ire of some lawmakers.\n\nTo give you a sense of what that means, consider that Waymo has a fleet of 3,000 vehicles and every week its vehicles drive over 4 million miles and provide over 400,000 rides. So, very few workers are monitoring lots of robotaxis.\n\nI have argued for years that AV companies need to do a better job of explaining what happens behind the scenes, particularly when it comes to remote guidance. Most companies, many of which no longer exist, avoided the topic like a plague, perhaps in an effort to make its tech seem more magical and innovative. Turns out, mystery breeds mistrust.\n\nWhile the debate over remote guidance operators plays out, Waymo continues to press into new markets. With one exception.\n\nNew York governor Kathy Hochulwithdrew a proposal that would have amended vehicle and traffic laws toeffectively legalize robotaxisin the state outside of New York City. Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler told me: “Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal.”\n\nOne more thing before we jump into the rest of the news. Mobility readers sure don’t believe the Rivian R2 will be priced at $50,000 or below. Last week, I polled you all and asked: “What will the starting price of the Rivian R2 launch edition be?” I gave three options, under $50,000, above $60,000, and above $70,000. More than 54% picked “above $60,000,” with the remaining two options split on the matter.\n\nTo participate in our polls, sign up for the Mobility newsletterhere.\n\nSenior reporterSean O’Kanegot the scoop from some little birds about layoffs atLucid. Here’s what we know. Lucid islaying off 12%of its workforce, according to an internal memo that TechCrunch has viewed. We don’t have an exact figure on workers affected, but it is likely hundreds.\n\nLucid has not filed its 2025 annual earnings yet, which would disclose how many employees it had at the end of the year. The company reported having 6,800 full-time employees globallyat the end of 2024.\n\nSince our report came out, O’Kane has learned a bit more. Affected employees found out early Friday morning, with a few learning that something was amiss when they lost access to Microsoft Teams. They are technically being placed on a 60-day “administrative leave” and won’t be officially laid off until late April.\n\nGot a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec atkirsten.korosec@techcrunch.comor my Signal at kkorosec.07, or email Sean O’Kane atsean.okane@techcrunch.com.\n\nAmari AI, a startup that uses AI tools to help custom brokers modernize and navigate President Trump’s trade policies,raised $4.5 millionof funding co-led by preeminent early-stage firms First Round Capital and Pear VC. The startup says it has already collected more than 30 customers and helped those firms move more than $15 billion of goods.\n\nKavak, the Mexico-based online used car dealer,raised $300 millionin an equity round led by Andreessen Horowitz, which put in $200 million. Other investors included WCM Investment Management, which co-led the round, and Foxhaven Asset Management.\n\nLanzaJet, a next-gen fuels technology company and fuels producer,raised $47 millionin the first close of a targeted $135 million equity round. The company said its pre-money valuation is $650 million. The was co-led by IAG and Shell, with participation from Groupe ADP, LanzaTech, and Mitsui.\n\nMetafuels, a sustainable aviation fuel startup based in Switzerland,raised $24 millionin a Series A round led by UVC Partners. Other investors included Energy Impact Partners, Contrarian Ventures, RockCreek, Verve Ventures, and Fortescue.\n\nFordis working hard to make shareholders forget about the $19.5 billion hit it took late last year. Instead, it wants them to see a tech-forward and nimble company building a future profitable product that will usher in a new era. The company, which has promised to deliver an EV truck that starts at $30,000 and can compete with Chinese automakers without undermining profit margins, sharedhow it plans to hit that goal. Will a combination of 3D-printed Lego-like parts, Formula 1 thinking, and a bounty program be enough?\n\nAI data center fever has spread. Just take a look atRedwood Materialsfor proof. The battery recycling and materials startup launched an energy storage business last year with a focus on AI data centers. The business, Redwood Energy, is now the fastest-growing unit within the company.Read my full story to understand what that means.\n\nRivianis launching a companion app that will let owners perform basic tasks such as locking and unlocking doors, venting windows, and triggering the vehicle alarmusing their Apple Watch. The company released a broader software update with a number of other new vehicle features as well.\n\nTeslalost its bid to overturn a jury’s$243 million verdictin a fatal Autopilot crash trial. Reminder: Tesla could havesettled this casefor $60 million. The company did score a win, however, with theCalifornia Department of Motor Vehicles. The state agency said itwill not suspendTesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days because the EV maker has stopped using the term “Autopilot” in the marketing of its vehicles in the state.\n\nI periodically test vehicles to keep pace with the latest in-car tech, EVs, and hybrids — or software updates in them. Coincidentally, I had aLucid Air Touringsedan this week.\n\nIt’s been at least a year since I was behind the wheel of an Air. And I’ve been anxious to try the company’shands-free driver-assistance systemthat launched last July. My past experiences with the company’s advanced driver-assistance system, called Dream Drive, has left me unimpressed. My vehicle would often ping-pong in the lane (meaning it had trouble centering itself) or would stay too close to the edge, which put me uncomfortably close to the big rigs I passed on the highway.\n\nI am happy to report that Lucid appears to have fixed these issues. Engaging the hands-free system was straightforward and it didn’t allow me to abuse it for long. As you see in the picture above, if I put a phone in front of my face, a warning was almost immediately triggered.",
