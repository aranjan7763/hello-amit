      "content": "Thenow-viral X postfrom Meta AI security researcher Summer Yue reads, at first, like satire. She told her OpenClaw AI agent to check her overstuffed email inbox and suggest what to delete or archive.\n\nThe agent proceeded to run amok. It started deleting all her email in a “speed run” while ignoring her commands from her phone telling it to stop.\n\n“I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb,” she wrote, posting images of the ignored stop prompts as receipts.\n\nThe Mac Mini, an affordable Apple computer that sits flat on a desk andfits in the palm of your hand, has become the favored device these days for running OpenClaw. (The Mini is selling “like hotcakes,” one “confused” Apple employee apparently toldfamed AI researcher Andrej Karpathywhen he bought one to run an OpenClaw alternative called NanoClaw.)\n\nOpenClawis, of course, the open source AI agent that achieved fame through Moltbook, an AI-only social network. OpenClaw agents were at the center of thatnow largely debunked episodeon Moltbook in which it looked like the AIs were plotting against humans.\n\nBut OpenClaw’s mission, according to itsGitHub page, is not focused on social networks. It aims to be a personal AI assistant that runs on your own devices.\n\nThe Silicon Valley in-crowd has fallen so in love with OpenClaw that “claw” and “claws” have become thebuzzwords of choicefor agents that run on personal hardware. Other such agents includeZeroClaw,IronClaw, andPicoClaw. Y Combinator’s podcast team even appeared on theirmost recent episodedressed in lobster costumes.\n\nBut Yue’s post serves as a warning. As others on X noted, if an AI security researcher could run into this problem, what hope do mere mortals have?\n\n“Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?” a software developer asked her on X.\n\n“Rookie mistake tbh,” she replied. She had been testing her agent with a smaller “toy” inbox, as she called it, and it had been running well on less important email. It had earned her trust, so she thought she’d let it loose on the real thing.\n\nYue believes that the large amount of data in her real inbox “triggered compaction,” she wrote. Compaction happens when the context window — the running record of everything the AI has been told and has done in a session — grows too large, causing the agent to begin summarizing, compressing, and managing the conversation.\n\nAt that point, the AI may skip over instructions that the human considers quite important.\n\nIn this case, it may have skipped her last prompt — where she told it not to act — and reverted back to its instructions from the “toy” inbox.\n\nAs several otherson X pointed out,prompts can’t be trustedto act as security guardrails. Models may misconstrue or ignore them.\n\nVarious people offered suggestions that ranged from the exact syntax Yue should have used to stop the agent, to various methods to ensure better adherence to guardrails, like writing instructions to dedicated files or using other open source tools.\n\nIn the interest of full transparency, TechCrunch could not independently verify what happened to Yue’s inbox. (She didn’t respond to our request for comment, though she did respond to many questions and comments sent her way on X.)\n\nBut it doesn’t really matter.\n\nThe point of the tale is that agents aimed at knowledge workers, at their current stage of development, are risky. People who say they are using them successfully are cobbling together methods to protect themselves.\n\nOne day, perhaps soon (by 2027? 2028?), they may be ready for widespread use. Goodness knows many of us would love help with email, grocery orders, and scheduling dentist appointments. But that day has not yet come.",

      "content": "Uber has a pitch for autonomous vehicle makers: we got this.\n\nThe ride-hailing and food delivery company has launched a new division called Uber Autonomous Solutions designed to take on all the tasks associated with operating a robotaxi, self-driving truck, or sidewalk delivery robot business, including software and support services.\n\nThe initiative, announced Monday, formalizes what Uber has been not so quietly working on for several years now.\n\nUber has amassed partnerships with nearly two dozen autonomous vehicle technology companies across every use case, from robotaxis and trucking to sidewalk delivery robots and drones. Uber has backed many of these companies —Lucid and Nuro,Waabi, and China’sWeRide— invested $100 million to build fast-charging, autonomous-vehicle charging stations, and even launchedUber AV Labs, a specialized engineering team that will gather data for robotaxi partners.\n\nUber has made the partnerships and investments; now it wants to make itself indispensable.\n\n“AV tech teams should be able to focus on what they do best: building software that can safely power an autonomous world,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s global head of autonomous mobility and delivery, who will be leading the initiative. The idea, he said, is to add “operational depth wherever they need it,” including demand generation, rider experience, customer support, or managing the day-to-day fleet operations.\n\nThe end goal is to help these companies reduce their costs per mile and increase the speed to market. Uber said it plans to help these partners scale robotaxi deployments tomore than 15 cities by the end of this year.\n\n“What’s going to determine the success or failure of autonomous in the world is whether it can be commercialized, and Uber is going to be the thing that makes autonomy commercially viable,” Uber President and COO Andrew MacDonald said.\n\nFor Uber that means handling infrastructure like training data and mapping, fleet financing, regulatory services, and managing how robotaxis and other AVs navigate complex events and venues. The company said it is using a fleet of specially equipped Lucid vehicles to collect data that can be shared with partners so they can train their AI systems.\n\nThe new division also plans to tackle user experience, including customer support. Notably, Uber wants to take over fleet management, which would include remote assistance — an issue that recently received attention from federal lawmakers over concernsWaymo uses workers overseas. Fleet management would also cover insurance and employing the humans who might need to support these AVs when they’re out in the world.\n\nUber’s move is both existential and opportunistic. The company sold its in-house AV development unit known as Uber ATG in 2020, following two years of internal struggles and pressure after one of its test vehicles killed a pedestrian. (Uber sold off the division in acomplex deal with Aurora.)\n\nIt has tried to shore up its position through partnerships and investments. And there have been plenty. Uber and Waymo have a shared robotaxi service in Atlanta and Austin. The company has also locked up partnerships with Chinese firms Baidu, Momenta, and Pony.ai, sidewalk delivery bot companies Cartken, Starship, and Serve, and the U.K.-based automated driving tech startup Wayve, as well as robotaxi developers AVride and Motional, to name a few. It has plans to launch a robotaxi service with Volkswagen in Los Angeles by the end of 2026 — although it won’t be driverless until 2027.\n\nThese do provide Uber with some protection, but it doesn’t provide a replacement to any revenue lost if these companies erode its own ride-hailing and food delivery business that is today powered by human drivers. Uber is hoping this new division will.\n\nLoading the player…",

Alocal reportcited strong opposition to the surveillance technology, with residents raising privacy concerns.\n\nOther cases of vandalism have stretched from California and Connecticut to Illinois and Virginia.

      "content": "With OpenAI onthe verge of finalizing a new $100 billion round, and Anthropic just closing its own monster$30 billion raise, one thing is clear: The concept of investor “loyalty” is only hanging on by a thread.\n\nAt least a dozen direct investors in OpenAI wereannouncedas backers in Anthropic’s $30 billion raise earlier this month, including Founders Fund, Iconiq, Insight Partners, and Sequoia Capital.\n\nSome dual investments are understandable if they come from the hedge fund or asset manager worlds, where their focus is still largely investing in public stocks (competitors or not). These include D1, Fidelity, and TPG.\n\nOne of these was a bit shocking. Affiliated funds of BlackRock joined in Anthropic’s $30 billion raise even though BlackRock’s senior managing director and board memberAdebayo Ogunlesiis also on OpenAI’s board of directors.\n\nIn that world, it’s true that if various BlackRock funds get a chance to own OpenAI stock, they are likely to take it, never mind the personal association of a member of their senior leadership. (BlackRock runs every type of fund, including mutuals, closed-ends, and ETFs). And we all know thehistory of OpenAI and Microsoft’s relationshipand why Microsoft is hedging its bets. Ditto for Nvidia.\n\nBut venture capital funds have — until now — operated differently.\n\nVCs market themselves as “founder friendly” and “helpful,” the idea being that when a VC firm buys a chunk of a startup’s company, the investor will help that startup be successful, particularly against its major rivals. If you are an owner of both OpenAI and Anthropic, who does your loyalty belong to, besides your own investors?\n\nAdditionally, startups are private companies. They typically share confidential information with their direct investors on their business status — data that isn’t disclosed publicly the way it is with public companies. In many cases, the VCs also take board seats, which carries another level of fiduciary responsibility to their portfolio companies.\n\nWhat makes this particular case even more interesting is that Sam Altman comes from the world of venture capital, as a former president of Y Combinator. He knows the drill. In 2024, he reportedly gave his investorsa list of OpenAI’s rivalsthat he didn’t want them to back. It largely included companies launched by folks who left OpenAI, including Anthropic, xAI, and Safe Superintelligence.\n\nAltman later denied that he told OpenAI investors they would be barred from future rounds if they backed his list of perceived rivals. Altman did admit that he said if they “made non-passive investments,” they would no longer receive OpenAI’s confidential business information, according todocuments in the lawsuitbetween Elon Musk and OpenAI,Business Insider reported.\n\nAI is also breaking the mold because of the record-breaking amounts of money that the largest AI labs are raising as they experience never-before-seen growth (and never-before-seen data center needs). At some point, when the hat is being passed around, the needs are so great and the possibilities of returns are so large, who can be expected to say no?\n\nIt turns out that not all venture investors have yet slid down the slippery slope. Andreessen Horowitz backs OpenAI but not (yet) Anthropic. Menlo Ventures backs Anthropic but not (yet) OpenAI, for instance.\n\nIn fact, in our admittedly not exhaustive research, we found a dozen investors that appear to only have direct investments in one of these companies, not both.\n\nOthers include Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst, and Greenoaks. (Note: We originally asked Claude to give us the list of dual investors. It got almost as many entries wrong as it got right, so all this for a very cool tech whose work sometimes remains less trustworthy than an intern’s.)\n\nStill, as we previously reported, the fact that this longstanding rule has been tossed by some of the most respected firms in the Valley,like Sequoia, is notable. One investor we reached out to simply shrugged and said that as long as the firm doesn’t have a board seat, no one sees the harm in it anymore.\n\nStill, conflict-of-interest policies should now become another thing that founders ask about before signing that term sheet, no matter who it’s from.",

OpenAI sent a memo to House lawmakers earlier this month accusing DeepSeek of using distillation to mimic its products.\n\nDeepSeek firstmade wavesa year ago when it released its open source R1 reasoning model that nearly matched American frontier labs in performance at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is expected to soon release DeepSeek V4, its latest model, whichreportedlycan outperform Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in coding.\n\nThe scale of each attack differed in scope. Anthropic tracked more than 150,000 exchanges from DeepSeek that seemed aimed at improving foundational logic and alignment, specifically around censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries.\n\nMoonshot AI had more than 3.4 million exchanges targeting agentic reasoning and tool use, coding and data analysis, computer-use agent development, and computer vision. Last month, the firmreleaseda new open source model Kimi K2.5 and a coding agent.\n\nMiniMax’s 13 million exchanges targeted agentic coding and tool use and orchestration. Anthropic said it was able to observe MiniMax in action as it redirected nearly half its traffic to siphon capabilities from the latest Claude model when it was launched.\n\nAnthropic says it will continue to invest in defenses that make distillation attacks harder to execute and easier to identify, but is calling on “a coordinated response across the AI industry, cloud providers, and policymakers.”\n\nThe distillation attacks come at a time whenAmerican chip exportsto China are still hotly debated. Last month, the Trump administration formally allowed U.S. companies like Nvidia toexport advanced AI chips(like the H200) to China. Critics have argued that this loosening of export controls increases China’s AI computing capacity at a critical time in the global race for AI dominance.\n\nAnthropic says that the scale of extraction DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot performed “requires access to advanced chips.”\n\n“Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,” per Anthropic’sblog.\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think-tank and co-founder and former CTO of CrowdStrike, told TechCrunch he’s not surprised to see these attacks.\n\n“It’s been clear for a while now that part of the reason for the rapid progress of Chinese AI models has been theft via distillation of U.S. frontier models. Now we know this for a fact,” Alperovitch said. “This should give us even more compelling reasons to refuse to sell any AI chips to any of these [companies], which would only advantage them further.”\n\nAnthropic also said distillation doesn’t only threaten to undercut American AI dominance, but could also create national security risks.\n\n“Anthropic and other U.S. companies build systems that prevent state and non-state actors from using AI to, for example, develop bioweapons or carry out malicious cyber activities,” reads Anthropic’s blog post. “Models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain those safeguards, meaning that dangerous capabilities can proliferate with many protections stripped out entirely.”\n\nAnthropic pointed to authoritarian governments deploying frontier AI for things like “offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance,” a risk that is multiplied if those models are open sourced.\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot for comment.\n\nThis article has been updated to clarify Dmitri Alperovitch was formerly CTO of Crowdstrike.",

It’s one of the hardest things to predict,” Grossman told TechCrunch via a telephone interview. “And our biggest pet peeve with a lot of weather apps is you just get their best guess, and you don’t know how certain they are.”\n\nHaving an understanding of the alternatives helps people plan for big events, he noted.\n\n“I find it most useful for winter storms, where, maybe the storm starts out in the morning, and you’re going to get snow, but maybe there’s also a possibility it holds out a little bit later — to the afternoon — in which case it’s rain,” Gross explained. “Being able to just see that right there on the timeline just gives you this intuitive sense of whether, do all the models agree, and you’re getting snow? Or do half of them say snow and half of them say rain?” he says.\n\nThis type of weather data could make for a valuable product, not just for consumers, but for other developers, too.\n\nAt Dark Sky, the team had offered its weather API to developers for a fee. After being acquired by Apple, the team worked on creatingWeatherKit, the developer toolkit that provides access to Apple’s weather data on a subscription basis. Grossman said the team hasn’t yet decided if a developer API will be a part of Acme Weather’s offering.\n\nInstead, Acme Weather is a $25-per-year consumer app, with a two-week free trial. This helps to cover the costs involved with pulling in thedifferent weather models and resources, which can be expensive.\n\n“Most of our time has been spent on building our own forecast — our own data provider, in a way. And this lets us do things like build multiple forecasts … [and] create any map we want, rather than having to rely on a third-party map provider,” Grossman noted.\n\nAt launch, the app offers a range of maps, like radar, lightning, rain and snow totals, as well as wind, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and hurricane tracks.\n\nAnother feature, Community Reports, lets users share information about their current conditions to improve the app’s real-time weather reporting.\n\nWhile Dark Sky had become a favorite weather app because of its uncanny ability to predict when it would begin raining in your location, Acme Weather aims to improve on this and even have some fun.\n\nThe app includes built-in notifications for typical things, like rain, nearby lightning, community reports, government-issued severe weather alerts, and more. It’s also going to experiment with alerts like rainbow predictions or when you might see a beautiful sunset.\n\nThese will be available in a special “Acme Labs” section of the app, and Grossman said they’ll be conservative with their predictions, given the difficulty.\n\nUsers will also be able to customize their notifications to focus on weather events they care about, like wind or UV index, or the possibility of rain over the next 24 hours.\n\nBeing able to try new ideas is part of what drew the team back to building an indie app, Grossman noted.\n\n“I absolutely love Apple … but as a big company, it’s difficult to try weird, new, experimental ideals. If you have a billion users, mistakes are costly,” he tells TechCrunch. “There’s long software development cycles, there’s a lot of stakeholders, this idea of being able to try a bunch of things, I think, is interesting.”\n\nAcme Weather is currently available on iOS. An Android version is planned.\n\nThe team is bootstrapped and includes co-foundersJosh ReyesandDan Abrutyn, also previously of Dark Sky. The small workforce includes both former Dark Sky team members and new hires.",

Preply, for instance, will use the proceeds of its latest round tohire some 100 engineersacross its global teams — including in Ukraine, where one-third of its engineering staff is based.\n\nPreply is one example among many. Defense techhas grabbed the most attention, especially for the speed at which innovations reach the battlefield. But the same engineering talent and ingenuity are emerging as a common denominators across sectors that also contribute to strengthening Ukraine.\n\nWith Ukraine facing a far larger attacker, the countrytakes a dim viewof efforts to escape mobilization. However, startups can be granted special status that shields key employees from the draft if they are deemed to support the country — andAspichiis one of them, its founder, Victor Samoilenko, told TechCrunch.\n\nOriginally created in the U.S. in 2021, the company completely pivoted when the war started. It is now best known for Luminify,a mixed-reality platform for mental health carethat has been helping Ukrainians cope with wartime trauma. The startup collaborates directly with military units as well as with a dozen clinics that provide mental health support to the population.\n\nThere are soldiers and veterans, bereaved families, and millions who have moved to western Ukraine or abroad. And for those who have always lived in Kyiv, the psychological toll is no less horrendous.\n\n“Everybody is suffering,” Samoilenko said. “My daughter celebrated several New Year’s and Christmas underground; so the effect is enormous.”\n\nIn a winter marked by near-daily attacks on the power grid, Ukraine’s capital hasn’t been spared. According to Natali Trubnikova, CMO at Kyiv-based IT consultancy firmGart Solutions, locals have adapted to power cuts with high-capacity power banks, gasoline stoves, and diesel generators. But rising costs mean they still have to use these sparingly, often keeping indoor temperatures to a strict minimum.\n\nThese harsh conditions have turned offices into refuges from the cold.\n\n“Our office has different generators so we have electricity, internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch last month.\n\nFor smaller startups, coworking spaces have also become havens.LIFT99 Kyiv Hub, a six-year-old venue thatsuffered damagefrom a Russian strike last August, has seen its membership numbers surge since its reopening two months ago, its sales and partnership manager Lada Samarskawroteon LinkedIn.\n\nDespite missile strikes, Kyiv is far enough from the frontline to remain Ukraine’s main startup hub, but it is not the only one. Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, has drawn many displaced Ukrainians — tech workers among them.LEM Station, arenovated tram depotturned creative space, is a symbol of its growing ecosystem, which has also benefited from its proximity to the Polish border.\n\nForeign visitors have been fewer, but with Lviv still reachable by train, tech conference IT Arena 2025brought 6,450 participantsfrom more than 40 countries to the city.  Defense tech had its own stage, but the event also showcased support for a wider range of startups. Despite the war, VC firms remain active in the country, including1991,Flyer One Ventures, andSMRK.\n\nDespite the long journey, Ukrainians are still making the trip to tech conferences abroad too. At Techarena in Stockholm earlier this month, members of aUkrainian delegationtold TechCrunch they were tired and waiting for the spring. But before saying goodbye, they started listingUkraine’s unicorns— because that’s what you do, even in the middle of a war.",

      "content": "Meta plans to purchase potentially up to $100 billion worth of AMD chips, enough to drive roughly six gigawatts of data center power demand, the companies announced Tuesday.\n\nAs part of the multiyear agreement, AMD has issued Meta a performance-based warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock — or about 10% of the company — for $0.01 each, structured to vest alongside certain milestones. The full stock award is conditional on AMD’s share price, which would need to hit $600 for Meta to receive its final tranche,per The Wall Street Journal. AMD’s stock closed at $196.60 on Monday.\n\nUnder the agreement, Meta will purchase AMD’s MI540 series of GPUs and its latest generation of CPUs. CPUs are increasingly becoming a core pillar of the AI inference compute stack because they’re efficient, easier to scale, and don’t tie companies solely to Nvidia.\n\n“The CPU market is absolutely on fire,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said Tuesday morning during an investor briefing. “There is significant demand. It has continued to grow, and it really is a result of the AI infrastructure deployments as inferencing scales, as agentic AI scales, and our portfolio is in an extremely good position.”\n\nAMD has been slowly gaining ground as AI firms look to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, which has been the longstanding leader in AI chips and has charged a premium for the title. Last October,AMD and OpenAI struck a similardeal trading equity for an agreement to buy chips.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the firm’s partnership with AMD is “an important step” as it diversifies its compute and works towards “personal superintelligence.” Zuckerberg has defined personal superintelligence as AI systems designed to deeply understand and empower individuals in their everyday lives.\n\nMeta has pledged to invest at least$600 billion in U.S. data centersand AI infrastructure over the next several years, including a projected capital expenditure spend of$135 billion in 2026.Meta recently unveiled plans for a $10 billiongas-powered data center campusin Indiana designed for 1 gigawatt of compute capacity.\n\nThe AMD partnership comes a couple of weeks after Meta struck amultiyear dealto expand its data centers with millions of Nvidia’s latest CPUs and GPUs. The Facebook-maker is also working on its own in-house chips but hasreportedlyhit delays.\n\nThis article has been updated with more information from AMD CEO Lisa Su.",
