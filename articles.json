      "content": "OpenAI has raised $110 billion in private funding, the companyannounced Friday morning, commencing one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.\n\nNotably, the round remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join as it proceeds.\n\n“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”\n\nAs part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.\n\nThe company’s previous round closed in March 2025, raising $40 billion against a $300 billion valuation. At the time, it wasthe largest private funding round on record.\n\nAs part of itsAmazon partnership, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run onAmazon’s Bedrock platform. The company will also expand itspreviously announced AWS partnership, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Trainium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.\n\n“We have lots of developers and companies eager to run services powered by OpenAI models on AWS,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement, “and our unique collaboration with OpenAI to provide stateful runtime environments will change what’s possible for customers building AI apps and agents.”\n\nThe Information hadpreviously reportedthat $35 billion of Amazon’s investment could be contingent on the company either achieving AGI or making its IPO by the end of the year. OpenAI’s announcement confirms the funding split, but says only that the additional $35 billion will arrive “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.”\n\nOpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.\n\nNvidia’s participation in the round has been the subject of intense speculation, particularly as reports of a $100 billion investment in September gave way to reports of a smaller investment in the months that followed.\n\nIn January,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed the idea that Nvidia was backing away from OpenAI, saying, “we will invest a great deal of money. I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible.”",

But as the Pentagon’sFriday afternoon deadlinefor Anthropic’s compliance approaches, more than 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signedan open letterurging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.\n\nSpecifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.\n\n“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”\n\nThe letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”\n\nLeaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.\n\nHowever, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altmansaidthat he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokespersonconfirmedthat the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.\n\nAgreed.  Mass surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment and has a chilling effect on freedom of expression. Surveillance systems are prone to misuse for political or discriminatory purposes.https://t.co/f2JRHAhjTW\n\nGoogle DeepMind has not formally addressed the conflict, but Chief Scientist Jeff Dean, presumably speaking as an individual, did express opposition to mass surveillance by the government.\n\n“Mass surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment and has a chilling effect on freedom of expression,” Deanwroteon X. “Surveillance systems are prone to misuse for political or discriminatory purposes.”\n\nAccording to anAxiosreport, the military currently can use X’s Grok, Google’s Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT for unclassified tasks, and has been negotiating with Google and OpenAI to bring its technology over for use in classified work.\n\nWhile Anthropic has an existing partnership with the Pentagon, the AI company has remained firm in maintaining the boundary that its AI be used for neither mass domestic surveillance, nor fully autonomous weaponry.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegsethtold Anthropic CEO Dario Amodeithat if his company doesn’t concede, the Pentagon will either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to comply with military demands.\n\nIna statement on Thursday, Amodei maintained his company’s position. “These latter two threats are inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security,” the statement reads. “Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.”",

      "content": "Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal.\n\nPerplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.” More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.\n\nThe tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.\n\nTechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but inexample workflowson Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial or legal data, creating analysis, and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.\n\nPerplexity executives invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.\n\nThis tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.\n\nThe company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.\n\nNow, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research.\n\n“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.\n\nPerplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.\n\nPerplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.\n\n“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.\n\nIf one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.\n\nThe company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.\n\nStill, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.\n\nAnd there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.\n\nOne executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.\n\nHowever, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said.",

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagonbelievesit should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nThis isn’t about Anthropic or the specific conditions at issue. It’s about the broader premise that technology deeply embedded in our military must be under the exclusive control of our duly elected/appointed leaders. No private company can dictate normative terms of use—which…https://t.co/VHbtzWujDA\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m.deadlineDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. An Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch Amodei’s statement does not mean the firm is walking away from negotiations and is continuing to engage in good faith with the Department going forward.\n\n“The contract language we received overnight from the Department of War made virtually no progress on preventing Claude’s use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons,” an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch. “New language framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will. Despite DOW’s recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.”\n\nThe Department of Defense hasattempted to force Amodei’s handby either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters—with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei said. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\n\nTLDR, he’s saying: “We can just part ways.

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discoveryannouncedthat Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billionall-cash bidfor the legacy studio, andwould walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administrationshelvedor facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent toacquireWBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\nParamount will take on the about $33 billion in debt held by Warner Bros. Discovery, according to the deal. Larry Ellison, whose net worth is $201 billion,according to Bloomberg, has agreed to supply the additional equity to fulfill Paramount’s bid. Paramount’s market cap is about $12 billion.\n\nThe deal is also being financed by a $57.5 billiondebt commitmentfrom Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management.\n\nNetflix shares jumped as much as 10% in after-hours trading in New York.

In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nAs for severance, Dorsey told U.S. employees who are being cut that they will receive “your salary for 20 weeks + 1 week per year of tenure, equity vested through the end of [M]ay, 6 months of health care, your corporate devices, and $5,000 to put toward whatever you need to help you in this transition.” Employees outside the U.S. will receive “similar support” dependent on their countries’ policies, he added.\n\nSalesforce and Amazon are among a growing list of other companies that have madeenormousstaffingcutsciting the increased gains they are seeing from AI, though a Forrester Research report last monthcast some doubton how real those gains are versus the likelihood that many layoffs are financially driven.",

This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recentlysettled its lawsuitand instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth$3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians havespoken outagainst the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more.",
