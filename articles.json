      "content": "OpenAI has launched a new product to help enterprises navigate the world of AI agents, focusing on agent management as critical infrastructure for enterprise AI adoption.\n\nOn Thursday, AI giant OpenAI announced thelaunch of OpenAI Frontier, an end-to-end platform designed for enterprises to build and manage AI agents. It’s an open platform, which means users can manage agents built outside of OpenAI too.\n\nFrontier users can program AI agents to connect to external data and applications, which allows them to execute tasks far outside of the OpenAI platform. Users can also limit and manage what these agents have access to, and what they can do, of course.\n\nOpenAI said Frontier was designed to work the same way companies manage human employees. Frontier offers an onboarding process for agents and a feedback loop that is meant to help them improve over time the same way a review might help an employee.\n\nOpenAI touted enterprises, including HP, Oracle, State Farm, and Uber as customers, but Frontier is currently only available to a limited number of users with plans to roll out more generally in the coming months.\n\nThe company would not disclose pricing details in a press briefing earlier this week, according toreporting from The Verge. OpenAI declined to comment on pricing.\n\nAgent-management products become table stakes since AI agents rose to prominence in 2024. Salesforce has arguably the best-known such product,Agentforce, which the company launched in the fall of 2024. Others have quickly followed.LangChainis a notable player in the space that was founded in 2022 and has raised more than $150 million in venture capital.CrewAIis a smaller upstart that has raised more than $20 million in venture capital.\n\nIn December, global research and advisory firm Gartnerreleased a reportabout this type of software and called agent management platforms both the “most valuable real estate in AI” and a necessary piece of infrastructure for enterprises to adopt AI.\n\nIt’s not surprisi",

      "content": "On Thursday, Anthropic released the latest version of Opus — its most advanced model and a particularly important model for Claude Code. Opus 4.5 was only releasedlast November, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.\n\nPerhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.\n\n“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.\n\nOpus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5)currently offers. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.\n\nThe new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.\n\nWhite told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software d",

      "content": "Fusion power’s biggest question remains unanswered: how do you ensure the cost to start the fusion reaction isn’t higher than the price at which you can sell the power?\n\nPlenty of people have ideas, but no one has cracked it yet. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, is confident enough that it’s building a massive reactor that costs several hundred million dollars. But the device won’t be turned onuntil next year, leaving the question unanswered for now.\n\nOther companies that were founded more recently think they have a shot at building a fusion power plant for less, includingPacific Fusion, which today announced the results of a series of experiments it performed at Sandia National Laboratory that it says will eliminate some costly parts of its approach. The company exclusively shared the results with TechCrunch.\n\nFusion power promises to generate large amounts of electricity 24/7 and deliver it in a way that’s familiar to today’s grid operators. Most fusion startups are targeting the early to mid-2030s to switch on their first commercial fusion power plant.\n\nPacific Fusion ischasing an approachknown as pulser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF). At its core, it’s similar to theexperimentscarried out at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The company compresses small fuel pellets in rapid succession, and that compression causes atoms inside the fuel to fuse and release energy.\n\nBut where NIF uses lasers to kick off the compression, Pacific Fusion wants to use massive pulses of electricity. Those pulses will create a magnetic field that encircles the fuel pellet — about the size of a pencil eraser — causing it to compress in less than 100 billionths of a second.\n\n“The faster you can implode it, the hotter it’ll get,” Keith LeChien, co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion, told TechCrunch.\n\nOne of the challenges with pulser-driven ICF is that the process has typically needed a bit of a kickstart to work properly.

But a week later, it is clear that he is dead serious.\n\nThe most obvious step, of course, is the formal merger between SpaceX and xAI thatwent forward on Monday, officially drawing together Musk’s space and AI ventures in a way that makes a lot more sense if there’s some kind of joint infrastructure project planned.\n\nBut even beyond the merger, we’re starting to see the idea of orbital AI data clusters — essentially, networks of computers operating in space — cohere into an actual plan. On Wednesday, the FCC accepted the filing and set a schedule seeking public comment. It’s a pro forma step normally, but FCC chairman Brendan Carr took the unusual step ofsharing the filing on X. Throughout his tenure as chairman, Carr has shown himselfeager to help Trump’s friends and punish his enemies— so as long as Musk stays on Trump’s good side, the proposal is likely to sail through without issue.\n\nAt the same time, Elon Musk has started to flesh out the argument for orbital data centers in public. On anew episodeof Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison’s podcast “Cheeky Pint,” which also featured guest Dwarkesh Patel, Musk laid out the basic case for moving most of our AI computing power into space. Essentially, solar panels produce more power in space, so you can cut down on one of the main operating expenses for data centers.\n\n“It’s harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space,” Musk said in the podcast. “Any given solar panel is going to give you about five times more power in space than on the ground, so it’s actually much cheaper to do in space.”\n\nClose listeners will note that there is a bit of a gap in the logic here! It’s true that solar panels produce more power in space, but since power isn’t the only cost in operating a data center and solar panels aren’t the only way to power a data center, it does",

Until now, the feed has lived in the Meta AI app. By making Vibes available outside of the Meta AI app, the company is positioning it as a more direct competitor toSora, OpenAI’s AI-generated video and social appthat launched shortly after Vibes.\n\n“Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.”\n\nThe news was first reported byPlatformer.\n\nMeta says it doesn’t share specific numbers, but claims Vibes has performed well, with Meta AI usage continuing to grow steadily since its launch, which it believes signals demand for a standalone app.\n\nThe tech giant also notes that while users engage with content in Meta AI, a standalone app allows for a more focused experience for creation and engagement.\n\nVibes lets users generate a video from scratch or remix a video that they see on their feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.\n\nMeta says collaboration and sharing are on the rise, with many Vibes videos being messaged to friends, which the company says mirrors how people use Reels.\n\nIt’s worth noting thatMeta told TechCrunchlast week that, in ",

      "content": "ElevenLabs co-founder and CEO Mati Staniszewski says voice is becoming the next major interface for AI – the way people will increasingly interact with machines as models move beyond text and screens.\n\nSpeaking atWeb Summit in Doha, Staniszewski told TechCrunch voice models like those developed by ElevenLabs have recently moved beyond simply mimicking human speech — including emotion and intonation – to working in tandem with the reasoning capabilities of large language models. The result, he argued, is a shift in how people interact with technology.\n\nIn the years ahead, he said, “hopefully all our phones will go back in our pockets, and we can immerse ourselves in the real world around us, with voice as the mechanism that controls technology.”\n\nThat vision fueled ElevenLabs’s$500 million raisethis week at an $11 billion valuation, and it is increasingly shared across the AI industry.OpenAIandGooglehave both made voice a central focus of their next-generation models, while Apple appears to be quietly building voice-adjacent, always-on technologies throughacquisitions like Q.ai.As AI spreads into wearables, cars, and other new hardware, control is becoming less about tapping screens and more about speaking, making voice a key battleground for the next phase of AI development.\n\nIconiq Capital general partner Seth Pierrepont echoed that view onstage at Web Summit, arguing that while screens will continue to matter for gaming and entertainment, traditional input methods like keyboards are starting to feel “outdated.”\n\nAnd as AI systems become more agentic, Pierrepont said, the interaction itself will also change, with models gaining guardrails, integrations, and context needed to respond with less explicit prompting from users.\n\nStaniszewski pointed to that agentic shift as one of the biggest changes underway. Rather than spelling out every instruction, he said future voice systems will increasingly rely on persistent memory and context built up over time, making intera",

Coming just months after its Series B, Clay’s offer of liquidity was a rarity in a market where tender offers, as these types of secondary transactions are known, were still uncommon for relatively young companies.\n\nSince then, several other newer, fast-growing startups have allowed their staff to convert some of their stock into cash. Linear, a six-year-old AI-powered Atlassian rival, completeda tender offerat the same valuation as the company’s $1.25 billion Series C. More recently, the three-year-old ElevenLabs authorized a $100 million secondary sale for staff, at a valuation of$6.6 billion,doubleits previous value.\n\nAnd just last week, Clay, which has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $100 million in one year, decided it was again time for its employees to cash in on the company’s fast growth. The eight-year-old startup announced that its staff can sell stock at a valuation of$5 billion, a more than 60% increase from its$3.1 billionvaluation announced in August.\n\nThese secondary sales at increasingly higher valuations for young, perhaps still-unproven companies may initially appear to be a premature “cash-out” reminiscent of the 2021 bubble. The most infamous example of that time was Hopin, whose founder, Johnny Boufarhat, reportedly sold $195 million worth of his company’s stock just two years before the company’s assets were sold for atiny fractionof its peak$7.7 billionvaluation.\n\nBut there is a critical distinction between the 2021 boom and today’s market.\n\nDuring the ZIRP era, a large portion of the secondary deals provided liquidity almost exclusively to founders of buzzy companies like Hopin.
