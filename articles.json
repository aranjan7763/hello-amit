But unlike traditional short-form video apps, you don’t just watch and scroll in Gizmo — you play.\n\nDepending on the type of “Gizmo” you encounter, you might poke the screen, swipe, tap, draw, drag, and more to interact with the mini app. These Gizmos aren’t just games but are more like digital toys — things that could include interactive puzzles, memes, art, animation, or anything else a creator can dream up.\n\nThe result is an engaging, playful feed, where you can like and comment on the tiny creations and even remix existing Gizmos to create your own version, if you choose.\n\nWhat’s more, you don’t need to know how to code or even vibe code to get started. Instead, you can simply type out an AI prompt to explain your idea using natural language.\n\nThe app then leverages AI coding technology to turn your idea into an interactive experience by generating the code that makes it work. As part of this process, Gizmo will also render your idea visually to ensure that each app functions properly and runs smoothly. Apps are also vetted using AI and human moderation to ensure user safety, a companyFAQnotes.\n\nEvery post on gizmo is a mini app#brainrot#robloxmemes#lebronjamesedit\n\nGizmo hails from a New York-based startup calledAtma Sciences, co-founded by Rudd Fawcett and Brandon Francis, along with CEO Josh Siegel and CTO Daniel Amitay.

These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.\n\nMatch said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity, and trust.

He often posts about the company’s autonomous ride-hailing efforts, and has a board seat at AV company Waabi — so the appointment may be a signal of the company’s plans to expand its driverless investments and operations.\n\nIndeed, on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Krishnamurthysaidthe company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”\n\n“With large and growing free cash flows, over the coming years we will invest with discipline across a multitude of opportunities, including positioning Uber to win in an AV future,” Krishnamurthy wrote in astatementdetailing the company’s Q4 results.\n\nUber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on the call that he was convinced autonomous vehicles would “unlock a multitrillion-dollar opportunity,” for the company, adding that autonomy “fundamentally amplifies” the strengths of the company’s platform.\n\n“By the end of 2026, we expect to be facilitating AV trips in as many as 15 cities globally, with a roughly even split of U.S. and international cities. And by 2029, we intend to be the largest facilitator of AV trips in the world,” Khosrowshahi said.\n\nOver the past two years, Uber has amassed partnerships with at least 20 autonomous vehicle companies across a variety of use cases, including sidewalk delivery robots, robotaxis, and trucking. Waymo is perhaps its highest profile partner with shared robotaxi operations in Atlanta and Austin.

This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.\n\nLast quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI hasreportednearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around810 million MAUsin late 2025.\n\nThe recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.\n\nGoogle recently rolled out a more affordable plan,the Google AI Plus, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.\n\n“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors.\n\nGemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand.
