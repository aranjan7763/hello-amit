      "content": "A group of notable open source programmers are joining with a VC investor to launch a nonprofit called theOpen Source Endowmentin hopes of permanently solving the perennial issue with developing open source software: funding.\n\nBackers of the Open Source Endowment include Thomas Dohmke (the former GitHub CEO who raiseda record $60 million for his dev tool startup Entire); Mitchell Hashimoto (founder of HashiCorp,which sold to IBM for $6.4 billion last year); Supabase founder and CEOPaul Copplestone; an NGINX co-founder; the creators of Vue.js and cURL; plus execs from Elastic, Spotify, and others. All told, the project has over 50 donors so far.\n\nThe nonprofit, which just achieved formal 501(c)(3) status, has currently raised more than $750,000 in commitments. But if things go according to the plan of its founder,Konstantin Vinogradov, it will have $100 million in assets within seven years.\n\nVinogradov is a venture investor specializing in open source, AI, and infrastructure software, and was previously a general partner at Runa Capital. As such, he has “some experience with university endowments,” which are some of the largest investors in venture capital funds, he told TechCrunch.\n\nVinogradov says as he scoured the world for open source projects, one complaint kept popping up: “There is no source of sustainable funding for open source maintainers. And that’s a really big problem.” (“Maintainer” refers to the developers who work on open source projects, such as debugging, choosing and verifying features submitted by the community, or programming new features themselves.)\n\nThe endowment will support projects based on criteria such as its number of users, or how many other projects rely on that specific software to operate. It will also choose projects that are not already well-supported by grants, donations, or umbrella organizations such as Linux’s Alpha-Omega. Vinogradov has already assembled a board for the nonprofit.\n\nThe lack of money in open source is hardly new. Open source software is typically given away, and since the community often contributes time and efforts freely, up to 86% of open source developersare not paid for their work.\n\nThis isn’t much of a problem for hobbyists or for professional developers paid by their companies to maintain projects, but such a system stands on shaky ground. Open source software is the bedrock upon which the internet stands, and virtually every large company uses open source tools in some way. In fact, open source software accounts forup to 55% of the tech stack in organizations, and is present in everything from databases to operating systems.\n\nWhile it is certainly possible for open source developers to commercialize their free projectsto gain wealth beyond their wildest dreams, the odds, to misquote the Hunger Games, are not in their favor.\n\nThere is, and has been for decades, a core of developers who volunteer their time and efforts for free to manage popular, important, and critical projects. And many of them areburned out.\n\nThis issue came into the public’s consciousness briefly in 2014, with theOpenSSL Heartbleed disaster,where a bug was found in an open source security project, used by most of the internet, that was maintained by a single developer.\n\nThere have been many attempts to fix the funding situation over the years. Some projects take donations from corporate sponsors. For instance, The Linux Foundation, which brought in about$300 million last yearlargely from corporate sponsors, doles out grants to select projects through its Alpha-Omega Project. In 2025, Alpha-Omega issued $5.8 million to 14 projects, it said.\n\nSome projects take donations directly from corporate donors. In January, for instance, Anthropic donated$1.5 million to the Python Software Foundation. While the Foundation said it was thrilled to have that cash, Anthropicitself raised $30 billion this month. Such a donation is couch-change to the AI lab.\n\nStill, not every developer wants to take corporate donations, as there are worries of granting too much influence to donor companies. For instance, there was a big hubbub last year in the Ruby community surrounding some long-time maintainers leaving and its big sponsor Spotify,The Register reported.\n\nThe Open Source Endowment hopes to support projects while displacing such risks.\n\n“The only way to support open source sustainably is private funds,” says Vinogradov.\n\nWhy hasn’t an endowment been tried before? Endowments require patience, Vinogradov says. They invest many of their assets, spending only a fraction of their income in any given year, and require years or even decades to grow to a meaningful size.\n\nBut if done right, that patience will result in an independent fund that could support critical open source projects forever.",

The new model, which is technically Gemini 3.1 Flash Image, can create more realistic images than its predecessor. The model will also now become the default in the Gemini app for its Fast, Thinking, and Pro modes.\n\nThe company first releasedNano Banana in August 2025, prompting people to generate millions of images in the Gemini app, especially incountries like India. In November, the company releasedNano Banana Pro, which allows users to create more detailed and high-quality images.\n\nThe new Nano Banana 2 retains some of the high-fidelity characteristics of the Pro model but produces images faster. The company says you can create images with a resolution ranging from 512px to 4K, in different aspect ratios.\n\nNano Banana 2 can maintain character consistency for up to five characters and fidelity of up to 14 objects in one workflow for better storytelling. Users can also issue complex requests with detailed nuances for image generation, Google says. In addition, users can create media with more vibrant lighting, richer textures, and sharper detail.\n\nWith the launch, Nano Banana 2 will become the default model for image generation across all apps in the Gemini app. The company is also making it the default model for image generation in its video editing tool,Flow.\n\nIn Search, Nano Banana 2 will become the default for Google Search results via Google Lens and in AI Mode across 141 countries on the Google app and on the web across desktop and mobile.\n\nOnGoogle’s higher-end plans, Google AI Pro and Ultra, subscribers can continue to use Nano Banana Pro for specialized tasks by regenerating images via the three-dot menu.\n\nFor developers, Nano Banana 2 will be available in preview through the Gemini API, Gemini CLI, and the Vertex API. It will also be available through AI Studio andthe company’s development tool Antigravity, which was released last November.\n\nThe company said that all images created through the new model will have a SynthID watermark, which is Google’s mark to denote AI-generated images. The images are also interoperable withC2PA Content Credentials, created by an industry body consisting of companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Meta. Google said that since launching the SynthID verification inthe Gemini app in November, people have used it over 20 million times.",

It looked great on paper but didn’t really work in real life,” Lucena said.\n\nShe had learned firsthand that hiring is typically based on markers of success like college degrees, previous work experience, and a gut instinct. But she knew there had to be a better way. So she developed Mappa and spent years creating a proprietary dataset based on hundreds of interviews that allowed her team to analyze behavior based on biomarkers indicated through people’s speech patterns. Through this process, the Mappa team found that to make the right hire the first time, a candidate can’t just be great on paper; they also have to be compatible.\n\n“There’s no trait that’s good or bad inherently; it’s more of what environment do you put that person in, and what roles are better aligned with people’s sort of tendencies and styles. So that’s how we’ve been thinking about defining compatibility,” Lucena said in the podcast interview.\n\nMappa is powered by an all Latinx team that knows how frustrating it is to be overlooked based on superficial biases or a lack of the “correct” experiences. She describes them as underdogs that understand this problem on a personal level.\n\n“We are all underdogs. We are all folks that have been overlooked in some degree. And I guess that makes it even more important that we are the ones building this,” Lucena said. “Having people like us building this technology, at the level we are doing, with the quality we are able to get to the market and serving our clients the way we do. It also opens up a door for others to come and join and know that there are multiple ways still to build technology.”\n\nLucena’s best advice for early-stage founders who are hiring is to take your time and be sure the compatibility is there from the beginning to avoid the hassle of hiring, firing, and rehiring for the same role.\n\nIsabelle Johannessen is our host.Build Modeis produced and edited by Maggie Nye.

      "content": "Bumbleannouncedon Thursday that it’s adding a series of AI-driven features intended to help turn matches into lasting connections, including those that offer feedback and guidance on users’ bios, photos, and prompts.\n\nThe dating app’s new AI-suggested profile guidance tool will roll out globally and give “personalized, actionable feedback” on users’ bios and prompts. For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”\n\nAccording to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend 10 years ago, but it’s still new information to many users.\n\nIn Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”\n\nOf course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.\n\n“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”\n\nBumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”\n\nTinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool calledChemistry, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches.\n\nMeta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature thatasks to use its AI on photos in your camera rollthat you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\n\nAs these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking morereal-world experiencesthat are not intermediated by an app.",

      "content": "Meeting notetaker Read AI on Thursday launched an AI-powered email-based assistant called Ada, saying it helps users manage their schedules, answer questions based on a company’s knowledge base, and reply to out-of-office emails.\n\nThe company is calling Ada a “digital twin” that handles tasks for you around the clock. Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”\n\nWhen you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.\n\nAda can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada, can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.\n\nIf someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.\n\nRead AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (model context protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.\n\n“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch.\n\nThe company said that while Ada currently works via email, it will soon be available on Slack and Teams.\n\nOn the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar earlier this month, Shim told TechCrunch that the company now has over 5 million monthly active users and plans to grow that number to 10 million. He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.\n\nFor Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally.\n\nThe company, which has raised over$81 million in funding, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launchedSearch Copilotfor knowledge discovery for users, and last month it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics basedon internal and web knowledge.\n\nOther meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added“recipes” in the form of repeatable promptsto surface knowledge from meeting data.Quill, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks.",

The firm predicts that the volume will dip to only 1.12 billion this year.\n\nThe memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping long‑term TAM (Total Addressable Market), the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, said in a statement.\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average selling price of a smartphone is supposed to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, Smartphone ASP is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she mentioned.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, the Middle East and Africa will face shipments dropping over 20% year-over-year. Other markets like China and Asia Pacific (excluding Japan and China) will also decline by 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nIt noted that it expects RAM prices to stabilize by mid-2027.\n\nLast year, another analyst firm,Counterpoint, also noted that smartphone shipments would go down, but its predicted dip was only 2.6%.\n\nEarlier this year, co-founder and CEO of Nothing, Carl Pei, also said that smartphones will cost more in 2026 as memory modules for smartphones have started costing more for manufacturers. “Brands now face a simple choice: raise prices by 30% or more in some cases, or downgrade specs. The “more specs for less money” model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei noted.",

Now AI companies are trying a new tactic to get their tech to stick by partnering with consultants.\n\nOn Thursday, French AI research lab Mistral AI and global consulting giant Accentureannounced a multiyear partnership. The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.\n\nFinancial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.\n\nThis deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.\n\nWhile Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announceddeals with Accentureas well.\n\nThe agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its“Frontier Alliance”initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its newOpenAI FrontierAI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered withIBMandDeloitte.\n\nWill partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption? It’s unclear, but what is clear is that AI companies are definitely trying to find out.",
